    "Bg": "A congee mixed with kudzu powders for high fiber and satiety. In the early years, there were always peddlers with shoulder poles in the streets and alleys of Jinzhou. When the clinkering sounds of their bells come, people would know it was for selling Kudzu Congee. Therefore, the elderly also use tinkering sounds to refer to Kudzu Congee.",
