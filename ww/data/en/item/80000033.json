Firmament do incorporate Silver Lotus into this pastry.\nIt is said that the Silver Lotus only grows in thick snow, blooming amidst the cold. The residents on Mt. Firmament believe that this flower blooms in deep snow to show gratitude to the forest and to uphold a belief in eternal blossoming. Thus, they have wrapped this promise within this pastry. As the stars rise and the moon sets, as snow falls and melts, the people of Mt. Firmament will never forget their promises.",
