    "Bg": "A thick soup beloved by the Shorekeeper made with nothing fancy but the freshly caught seafood commonly found in coastal households. The secret is to add in heavy milk and reduce the soup slowly.\nIt's little known that the soup was a result of the Shorekeeper's effort to recreate a soup that used to bring her so much comfort. She tried to replicate it to the best of her recollection, but through numerous attempts, she ended up with a recipe with her personal touch. The sweetness of the seafood blends well with a freshly toasted slice of bread. Its warmth soothes fatigue and soul... Maybe that's what that person meant by a \"simple but certain\" happiness.",
