    "Name": "Viridite Dawnwood",
    "Desc": "A tall and luscious tree bearing a crown of green. As its wood is hard as steel, many structures use it to bear heavy loads. It is even used as the main material in making weapon shafts. Thus did it earn the name \"Viridite.\"\\nThis Viridite tree still bears a wood-colored trunk, and thus is not ready to be cut down and used yet. Thankfully, Viridite trees grow fast, so perhaps it might just be ready if you give it a few days.",
