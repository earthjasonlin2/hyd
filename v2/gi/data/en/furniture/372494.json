    "Name": "Cerulean Gem",
    "Desc": "Commonly found in the wild in Fontaine, the Cerulean Gem is brilliantly colored. Contrary to its dazzling appearance, the flower has nearly no fragrance. It swiftly curls into a hardened, fruit-like structure once plucked.\\nA certain Melusine deployed to the field had a fondness for the floweret and referred to it as \"Golden Gem Flower,\" but was corrected by her human colleague stating that it was \"cerulean.\" In reality, the vision of Melusines is very different from humans, while her colleague happened to be color-blind. The Cerulean Gem is actually close to pale violet red or rosy as defined by the Fontaine Research Institute. Nonetheless, the story of the Cerulean Gem has become an interesting anecdote, known from the Maison Gardiennage to all the streets and alleys of the Court of Fontaine.",
