    "Name": "Mud Frog",
    "Desc": "A small frog that often appears in wetlands.\\nThis animal is very common in wetland areas, and its body secretes a mysterious sticky substance that has much medicinal utility. As opposed to normal frogs, the yellow Mud Frogs are better at camouflaging themselves along wet banks.\\nThey say that in Fontaine, people refer to brigands who escape capture often or evildoers who evade judgment as \"mud frogs in butter.\" \\nAfter a long time spent living in the Serenitea Pot, other animal residents came to recognize the Mud Frogs' uncanny powers of camouflage. Even the sharpest cat might barely detect a passing Mud Frog as it moves along the shore â€” or at least, until it gets splashed in the face.",
