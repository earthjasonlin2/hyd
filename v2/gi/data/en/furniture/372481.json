    "Name": "A Different Kind of Sweetness",
    "Desc": "An ordinary-looking plant with no eye-catching features. The small red fruits on its upper section can be mixed in as a supplement to a Sumpter Beast's regular dried grass diet. To a Sumpter Beast, perhaps the fruits taste like a special dessert. However, these plants are not commonly found, so most Sumpter Beasts will only get to enjoy their dessert once in a while.",
