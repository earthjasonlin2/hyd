    "Name": "The Bamboo's Call",
    "Desc": "A furnishing for a courtyard right out of a poem, built using carefully sanded white stone and \"kintake\"-processed wood. The gurgling water flows into the \"kintake\" wooden tube, and once full, the shift in the tube's center of gravity will cause it to rotate and strike the stone, making a clean, clear sound that is very emblematic of Inazuma.",
