    "Name": "\"Mellow Tea in a Red Clay Pot\"",
    "Desc": "A red tea set made from carefully selected fine clay fired by a skilled artisan. It has a pedestrian appearance but has a warm luster and excellent tactile quality.\\nThey say that when tea is brewed using this special clay pot, the cup will blend perfectly with it and indeed, refresh itself with the said tea. The longer it spends in service serving, the more fragrant the tea, which is why it is so popular among the people of Chenyu Vale.",
