    "Name": "Forest Tree Frog",
    "Desc": "A small frog that often appears in wetlands.\\nThis animal is very common in wetland areas, and its body secretes a mysterious sticky substance that has much medicinal utility. Tree Frogs are well-suited to dwelling in rainforests.\\nIt is said that some tree frogs can glide between the trees. Research indicates that the principle behind such an ability is quite similar to that of wind gliders.\\nIncorporating some undulating terrain in the Realm Within to provide footholds for gliding may really thrill these special animal guests.",
