    "Desc": "Humanity's best friend!\\nThese originate from a canine species from the far north and have a body of thick gray-white fur. They are quite hardy against the cold and are of an honest and lively character.\\nHowever, the temperate climate of the Realm Within tends to lend to their lazy side. Be sure to play with them more to keep them from getting too fat!",
