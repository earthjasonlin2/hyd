    "Name": "Yumemiru \"Dewcover\" Wardrobe",
    "Desc": "A sealed Inazuman clothes cabinet. Its thickness and walls have been adjusted based on the unique features of Inazuman kimonos.\\nInazuma is surrounded on three sides by the ocean and the air is saturated with moisture, and as such, clothes are liable to become damp and moldy easily after being stored to a long time. As such, the upper section of this wardrobe contains a replaceable wooden box full of dried petals and sawdust that is used to absorb water and control the humidity within. This contraption actually works quite well, for the record.",
