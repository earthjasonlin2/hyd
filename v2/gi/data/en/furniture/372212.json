    "Name": "Chasm's Doorstep",
    "Desc": "Veteran miners can tell how deep beneath the surface they are based on the color of the rock beneath their feet. Once this kind of rock starts to appear, it means The Chasm is right up ahead. Because of this, it has been named the \"Chasm's Doorstep.\"\\nHowever, due to recent Ley Line disturbances, this stone has started appearing all over the place, rendering the miners' experience useless.",
