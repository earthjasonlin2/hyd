    "Name": "Foundations of Stone: Double-Time",
    "Desc": "A pavement created using dense stones. These stone slabs are arranged in a very special way that allows them to be deployed rapidly in order to pave roads.\\nThe clean, hard stones utilize a traditional art from Liyue that melts and melds smashed stone and sand grains together to form slabs that are sturdy, long-lasting, and inexpensive, thus making them much sought after across the continent.\\nAn army cannot fight without proper logistics. It is said that in the days of the ancient monster hunts, the Millelith placed great emphasis on the traffic capacity of roads, and so created a set of universal specifications for stone slabs to follow, right down to their composition and weight, such that they might pave roads as efficiently as possible. These basic paving units would eventually evolve into the floorings used today.",
