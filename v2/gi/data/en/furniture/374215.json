    "Name": "\"Azure Gem of the Springs\"",
    "Desc": "A wooden seat renowned for its water-blue soft cushion and intricate floral-patterned backrest, offering an exceptional seating experience, commonly seen in places like the \"Golden Dusk,\" used to welcome visiting guests. It is said that to enhance the vacation experience, a leader of the \"People of the Springs\" sought out a master craftsman from the \"Children of Echoes\" to create a chair that would provide supreme comfort. \"When one thinks of the 'People of the Springs,' the sea comes to mind; and when thinking of the sea, one inevitably will think of sapphires!\" —Thus, the master craftsman proposed the idea of inlaying a massive sapphire into the seat. Naturally, such an expensive solution was impractical for the \"People of the Springs.\" Ultimately, they chose a more reasonable option — opting for a thick and comfortable water-blue cushion as a substitute for the sapphire.",
