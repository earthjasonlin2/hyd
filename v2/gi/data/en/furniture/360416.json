    "Desc": "Uniquely shaped lantern stands with exquisitely crafted traditional lanterns. They are especially beautiful and can only be seen at the Lantern Rite Festival. When all sixteen lanterns are lit up, the bright and warm light is enough to illuminate a radius of hundred steps. It is said that the first lanterns to be lit on the eve of the festival are hung on this type of lantern stand, signaling the arrival of the festival.",
