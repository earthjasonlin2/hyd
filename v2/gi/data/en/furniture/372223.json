    "Name": "Ardent Cinnabar",
    "Desc": "These rugged, reddish-brown stones are often used to decorate courtyards.\\nThe name \"Ardent Cinnabar\" may come from a children's song. That song states that these rocks come from hills filled with red leaves. The crimson leaves would be swept away by the rainwater and would seep into the stones over time, thus giving these stones their unique color. Some have searched for this land that the children sang of, but they have mostly returned empty-handed.",
