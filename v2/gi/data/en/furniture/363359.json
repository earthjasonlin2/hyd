    "Desc": "A storage chest made from high-quality Linden Wood with a sturdy outer casing that can be reliably sealed, making it the number one choice for Fontaine's residents.\\nThanks to the efforts of the Maison Gardiennage, the Court of Fontaine enjoys excellent public security, and most residents thus do not require storage boxes with excessive security. As such, the convenience associated with this class of storage has always seen it placed at the top of furniture sales rankings.",
