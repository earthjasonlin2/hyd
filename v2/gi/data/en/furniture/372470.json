    "Name": "Flaming Azure",
    "Desc": "A bioluminescent plant in a very pale shade of azure that forever remains a bud, almost never blooming. They can be found in the forest and in the wilderness, occasionally accompanied by other bright flowers, and also bred in the Pardis Dhyai laboratories.\\nThe luminescent material extracted from these plants can be kept for a long time, but the yield is very low. The scholars seem to be planning to improve this breed and cultivate it on a large scale.",
