    "Desc": "A large and luxurious tent made with thick and sturdy fabric. This is a special construction born from the Knights of Favonius's years of camping out in the wild. It was once built by Lisa, the Honorary Knight, and Paimon to set up an alchemy shop beside Cider Lake.\\nUnlike normal wildland tents, this alchemy-shop-specialized tent has an eye-catching exterior to attract customers from afar, and also emphasizes practicality to ensure that the internal warmth and humidity are within optimal range to preserve the alchemical ingredients.\\nUnfortunately, due to the immense weight of this tent and the complexity of setting it up, the Knights do not presently intend to continue producing this tent type.",
