    "Name": "Hilichurl Totem Fence",
    "Desc": "A fence upon which a hilichurl banner has been hung. It has a mounted totem pole with great powers of deterrence, and the connection between the different timber flanks has been strengthened. Even the fierce infighting that may arise from the giant axe- or shield-wielding inhabitants of this camp will not break these fences.",
