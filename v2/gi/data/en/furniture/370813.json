    "Name": "Court of Justice's Newsstand",
    "Desc": "A metal-glass composite building unique to Fontaine, currently operating as a newsstand balances the display of all its merchandise with operating costs. While its size is comparable to traditional buildings, rent is extremely low and it requires just a single person to run. Customers can see everything sold from the sales counter. Unlike food, books and magazines are much easier to store, and the newspapers in stock are updated frequently and of much greater timely relevance, making newsstands actually more flexible than bookstores.",
