    "Name": "\"Quick Temporary Workshed\"",
    "Desc": "These simple sheds can be found in Poisson. Constructed with ordinary Cypress Wood frames, their interior spaces are spacious and can accommodate numerous storage boxes and tools. Poisson's residents are largely engaged in water-related occupations such as fishing and salvaging. The nature of these jobs means that their workplaces are not entirely fixed and often require the setting up of temporary sheds in the wilderness. However, typical tent structures do not adequately meet their need to withstand unpredictable winds and waves. Thus, temporary sheds with metal construction have emerged. It's worth noting that these sheds often feature a fish-shaped metal sign, one that is not to be mocked anywhere out in the wilds of Fontaine.",
