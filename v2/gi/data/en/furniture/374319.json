    "Desc": "Shelves constructed from high-strength Mallow Wood and metal, used for organizing and displaying goods. These are oft found throughout the Fortress of Meropide.\\nRumor has it that these so-called \"basic\" shelves were initially intended to be double-deck bunk beds for inmates to rest in. However, when the Duke assumed power, the treatment of Fortress inmates improved, and these uncomfortable beds were abandoned and repurposed into shelves for displaying goods.",
