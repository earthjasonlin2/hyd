    "Name": "Afternoon Coffee",
    "Desc": "A mobile coffee stand of unknown provenance. The entire cart is constructed of sturdy timber, with a bright red tablecloth spread over it. The interior of the cart has been painstakingly set up to ensure that the barista need not move about frequently, and can complete the entire process from taking the order to completing the coffee by simply turning about or moving slightly from side to side. The stand is stocked with a surfeit of ingredients, and much thought has been put into their arrangement, such that the barista may quickly create the caffeinated beverage according to the customer's wishes. The customers themselves may observe the entire magnificent process from the side, enjoying their custom coffee and a lovely afternoon.",
