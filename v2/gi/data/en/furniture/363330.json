    "Name": "The Mellow Pot",
    "Desc": "These elegant and intricately-crafted cups and tray have combined the arts of metal- and clay-working together. It is said that they can bring out the greatest in whatever drink you are having. These utensils appear in establishments selling food and beverages throughout Sumeru, such as Puspa Caf√©.\\nIf one were to make these cups the traditional way, one might have to spend gross amounts of time and material to do so, and the price would certainly take that into account. This in turn would turn the product into a pricey collector's item, thus depriving it of any practical use whatsoever. Fortunately, the upgrading of production equipment that the Kshahrewar Darshan has promoted has decreased the difficulty of manufacturing utensils of various kinds. At this point, they have already become quite common, such that these lovely yet functional items have even found a home in Aaru Village, lacking in material wealth though it is.",
