    "Name": "\"Skiff of the Springs\"",
    "Desc": "A compact, elegant wooden canopy constructed from \"White Chestnut Oak Wood\" boards. Due to its small size and light weight, it can hang from the edge of a building or the ground without additional support structures. Initially, to better monitor the hot spring area and prevent accidents, hot spring managers used discarded surfboards to create makeshift platforms with basic shading facilities. Unexpectedly, this \"uniquely designed\" rest area became quite popular among visitors, leading to the surfboard-style base becoming a notable feature of modern rest canopies.",
