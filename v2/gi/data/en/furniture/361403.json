    "Name": "Yumemiru \"Sakura's Rest\" Bed",
    "Desc": "An Inazuman bed that incorporates designs from other lands. Inazumans are accustomed to laying a futon directly on the tatami, but no matter how good the material of the tatami is, it is still harder than a bed.\\nSome visitors from Liyue think that if they sleep on the ground for a long time, moisture and dampness will invade the body and affect their health. Thus, talented Inazuma craftsmen developed this new type of bed, which combines Inazuma's fabric with the comfort of a bed from other lands, which is sufficient to cater to the needs of various users.",
