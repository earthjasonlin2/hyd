    "Name": "\"Trumpet and Firewood\"",
    "Desc": "A circular metal disk secured atop an Athelwood stand. Raising the burning firewood to eye level not only helps enhance an area's lighting conditions, but also prevents drunk mercenaries from accidentally faceplanting into the fire and getting burned. Some say that fires like these can even dance to the sound of trumpets. And to those who spend long nights in the desert, it is no doubt an uplifting sight.",
