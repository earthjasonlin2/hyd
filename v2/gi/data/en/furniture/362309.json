    "Name": "The Olive Grove",
    "Desc": "A gorgeous carpet made of tough plant fiber and excellent quality dye that has a memorable fruit-green motif and light-gold decorative patterns that reveal a luxurious look and feel.\\nIn reality, the prices of such rugs are so affordable that rug shops all over the Grand Bazaar sell them, and ordinary merchants use them as floor mats for their stalls. The reason for this is that the research theories of various scholars from the Akademiya have gradually been applied to the production process. It is said that the most promising advancement in rug fibers was an incidental result, born from a senior architecture researcher's work on lightweight building materials. However, the man himself seems to have no knowledge of this and is more concerned with the equipment that assists in the weaving process.",
