    "Name": "Sheriff Cat",
    "Desc": "An agile and wise soul, endowed since birth with a well-maintained elegance and pride.\\nThese cats are conscientious and cautious, elite hunters amongst their kind. Due to humans often delegating the vital task of defense against vermin to them, they are sometimes also called \"watch-leaders\" or \"sheriff cats.\"\\nHowever, life in the Realm Within is neat and orderly, with no outbreaks of ravaging pests and vermin. With nothing better to do, these jobless \"sheriff cats\" find renewed fulfillment in encouraging others of their kin to move and exercise.",
