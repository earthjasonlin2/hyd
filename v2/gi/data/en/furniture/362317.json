    "Name": "Peculiar Rug: \"Drama of Cards\"",
    "Desc": "A black-and-red rug with origins shrouded in mystery, it features a very novel design: Using four cards of various dimensions overlapping one another to create a kind of distorted visual effect, it makes the viewers witnesses to a wondrous magic card trick. Unlike conventional round or rectangular rugs, this sort of asymmetrical rug design leaves visitors with a feeling of novelty, and leaves them looking forward to all sorts of new and wondrous experiences and things â€” such as creative new cuisines.",
