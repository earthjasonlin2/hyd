    "Name": "Teahouse Folding Screen: Hidden Heart of Gold",
    "Desc": "A tall and narrow folding screen that may be found within Komore Teahouse.\\nThis screen's color coding is exactly the same as that of an age-old sweet tea. The tea leaves that have yet to touch water seem withered and brown, but the brewed tea has a golden color. A profound meaning lies underneath this matter, which is that even people who seem unruly and unkempt may yet be as valuable as gold.",
