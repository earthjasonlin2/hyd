    "Name": "Domed Gate: Forest Tune",
    "Desc": "One of the two styles of door frames for Sumeru Mansion: Meditative Retreat. This door frame's design is based off Sumeru's rainforests. It has a Brightwood frame thatched with a leafed roof, instilling it with flexibility and an appearance that makes it look like the entrance leading into a vast forest.\\nThanks to its unique architecture, when the wind rushes through this structure, it sometimes makes a noise akin to birdsong. Clueless as ever, Paimon once assumed the noise was Tubby's snores, and even stated that Tubby enjoyed singing in her sleep. This caused no end of confusion for the latter to puzzle through.",
