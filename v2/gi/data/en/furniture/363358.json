    "Name": "Compact Air Supply Device",
    "Desc": "A small, exquisite mechanism that is usually placed on an indoor table to send air to a fixed fan.\\nThanks to Fontaine's climate and the excellent architectural design of Fontainian buildings, their indoor environments are mostly cool and do not need any fans to reduce the temperature. Even if they buy such devices, people tend to protect their fan blades with an outer casing to prevent staining.",
