    "Name": "Desert Desk: Hospitality",
    "Desc": "A short table that can be found in Aaru Village and other places. It is made of Athel Wood soaked in dye to raise its moisture content, a process that prevents it from absorbing moisture present in indoor environments. It has a variety of uses. Sundries can be placed in the upper and lower compartments. It can also be used as a coffee table, and, with the aid of a cushion, can double as a chair.\\nThanks to its practical design, some Aaru Village residents place sumptuous refreshments on top of this table and store spare tea leaves and water bottles below to receive their guests with the highest courtesy. Of course, according to the rules of some families, a table that has been sat at cannot be used as a coffee table on the same day unless the cushions and tablecloths are replaced. Such families often keep a large number of rugs of different sizes at home and are key customers for merchants.",
