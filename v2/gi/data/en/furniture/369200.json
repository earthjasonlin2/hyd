    "Name": "Flowcurrent Bird",
    "Desc": "A peculiar bird that can walk on two feet yet cannot spread its wings to fly. Lively and friendly, they are often found in habitats close to water in groups, or floating on their backs in the water without a care in the world.\\nThe Flowcurrent Bird's body resembles a slender-necked water bottle, its gait wobbling and its flapping of wings somewhat awkward. After settling in the Serenitea Pot, the Flowcurrent Bird's clumsy movements seemed to trigger a protective instinct in many other birds, resulting in a flock of \"guardian birds\" always surrounding it.",
