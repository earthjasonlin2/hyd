    "Desc": "A Mondstadt-style main entrance to a mansion courtyard, solid and unyielding. The craftsman who designed the gate boasted that even the wild boars of the woods couldn't smash the gate down.\\nBut the reason he dared to make this claim is probably because he knew that a building where you might find a gate like this would not likely be located anywhere that a wild boar would find itself charging into it.",
