    "Name": "Valley Veranda: Distant Beginnings",
    "Desc": "A Liyue-style passageway with exquisite craftsmanship, made with the same design as the passageways in Yilong Wharf. In Liyue, walkways are not merely practical pathways for pedestrians but are themselves important sightseeing spots. Sometimes, artisans utilize the concept of overlapping scenery in their creations, allowing sightseers to focus on the details while close by, yet when seen from afar it will appear to open up, with far better views than from up close. Mayhap this is what the people of Liyue mean when they say \"A mountain is most magnificent from a distance.\"",
