    "Name": "Desert Hut: Minutiae",
    "Desc": "A hut that may be found in Aaru Village. It has a rather unique shape and features a shed on either wing.\\nDesert huts are not often built to block out the rain, but rather to provide people with shade. Even the desert folk, who are accustomed to the blazing sun, can be rendered dizzy and faint by its heat, never mind visitors from abroad. Putting a roof over workspaces is a formula for much decreased woes, even if many trivial things should happen during that time.",
