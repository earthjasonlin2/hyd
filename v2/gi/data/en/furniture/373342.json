    "Name": "Mt. Yougou Night Walk Red Kitsune Doll",
    "Desc": "A special gift from the children's storybook \"Night at Mt. Yougou\" found at the Magnificent Irodori Festival. Customers who are fortunate enough to buy a book with a coupon included will receive this intricate doll. The doll is based on the commonly seen kitsune of Inazuma, and adopts the classic wooden skeleton and thick cloth masking technology. The color is crimson under warm light, and the texture is as delicate as fine lacquerware. Every time you look at it, you can't help but remember the sight of every hair on a certain general's tail standing on end as he heard the word \"fox.\"",
