    "Name": "Brimming Freight Car",
    "Desc": "A sturdy and reliable model toy train car, featuring an eye-catching sky-blue theme decorated with finely crafted windmill ornaments. It is a scale reproduction of one of the cars of the Maritime Express.\\nIt is said that this was once used as a rest carriage, and retained its characteristic spaciousness after being modified. Not only does it have the capacity to hold a large quantity of luggage, but can even accommodate a conductor whose sole job is to keep an eye on the cargo. However, as the luggage is already well-protected by a toy bird that is both cute and clever, there seems to be little need to assign another conductor.",
