    "Name": "Indoor Lamp: The Twilight Sea",
    "Desc": "A popular light fixture among the citizens of Fontaine. Unlike ordinary wall-mounted lights, this model utilizes the presently popular suction cup mechanic, which eliminates the hassle of drilling holes in the wall for installation. The light has been deliberately adjusted to a soft, warm yellow, reminiscent of a gentle seascape under the sunset. Such warmth and tranquility may well be what \"the feeling of home\" in its advertising slogans was referring to.",
