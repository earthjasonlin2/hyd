    "Name": "Evernight Blazeshrub",
    "Desc": "A coral that grows profusely in the dark and gloomy places of Enkanomiya. Thanks to the sheer amount of them that grow, their pale white glow stands some chance against the dark. Perhaps after many long years, these corals might grow as large and sturdy as giant trees, but in cold and lonely Enkanomiya, bereft of a certain vitality, the Sangacorallia may just opt to continue slumbering.",
