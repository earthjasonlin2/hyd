    "Desc": "A basket woven with thin and resilient Brightwood strips. Its framework is made from Adhigama Wood. They say that this type of basket is \"too light for its weight to be felt,\" and even a child can lift it with ease. The wooden strips are spliced together, leaving gaps in the basket. Its wooden handle allows you to shake out as much water as possible and hence get rid of unnecessary weight.",
