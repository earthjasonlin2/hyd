    "Name": "Large Stone Mill",
    "Desc": "A traditional and highly efficient mill. Driving that barrel requires a great deal of power, which is usually where an attached waterwheel comes in.\\nHowever, the following legend exists in Qingce Village: that a certain thaumaturge once passed this way when he was stricken by some chronic malady. Needing some Mist Flower dust desperately, he turned the mill with his bare hands at a speed that far outmatched any waterwheel.",
