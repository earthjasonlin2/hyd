    "Name": "Large Shipping Pallet",
    "Desc": "A large box that can be found in Fontainian harbors. Its dimensions are somewhat larger, with two of them being able to be stacked securely atop any given pallet.\\nTo increase shipping efficiency, harbor staff hired researchers from the Fontaine Research Institute to carefully examine \"how best to ship lots of small cargo.\" The answer they found was this: miscellaneous goods could be stored inside medium-sized boxes of fixed dimensions, and these boxes could be fit snugly into larger boxes like building blocks, thus making efficient use of space. Eventually, a whole series of boxes was made, and the throughput of various harbors was increased greatly by this new optimized system.",
