    "Name": "Desert Fireplace: Warmth",
    "Desc": "A light-colored stone fireplace with a large enough space to hold longer planks of wood and allow them to burn at a moderate speed. It has a clever design that fits into the wall and hides the chimney flue without disrupting the surrounding interior design.\\nIt's true that the desert can give the impression of being extremely hot during the day, but late at night, as the heat escapes from the gravel, a dangerous chill often sets in. So fireplaces are important to desert settlements like Aaru Village. To reduce the hassle of lighting the fireplace at a specific time, a process was developed to treat the firewood with the roots of various desert plants. The processed firewood can burn long enough to keep the house comfortably warm both during the day and at night, and therefore saves people much trouble.",
