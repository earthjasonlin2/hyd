    "Name": "Fisherman's Clemency",
    "Desc": "A simple but very practical tool. A movable light Brightwood arm is fixed on a heavy mount made of Adhigama Wood. By swinging the arm, fishermen can cast their nets into the river to catch fish that are swimming downstream. The design was based on theories devised by Vahumana and Amurta researchers. The mesh size is designed such that only adult fish will be caught. This prevents overfishing and its destructive effects on fishing resources.",
