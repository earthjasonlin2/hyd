    "Name": "Music Town's Breeze Bells: \"Cheeping Finches\"",
    "Desc": "Small and delicately crafted metal wind chimes with blue cloth ribbons. Their sound is crisp, like the cheeping of the Bluecrown Finch, music to the ear. They can be found within Petrichor.\\nSome Fontainians believe that the timid Bluecrown Finch is quite sensitive to the environment in which they live, and that they will only lift their voices in song when they are in a safe and comfortable place. For this reason, a Bluecrown Finch beneath a tree signifies \"safety\" and \"comfort.\" Thus, the people of Petrichor like to place these chimes with sounds like that of the Bluecrown Finch in the treetops, such that it may be made a place where any finch would cheep freely and happily.",
