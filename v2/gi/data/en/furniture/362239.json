    "Name": "Hued Vase: Molten Sand",
    "Desc": "A tall pottery piece with an elegant appearance often seen in larger shops and exquisitely furnished restaurants around Sumeru City and Port Ormos. It is well-suited for storage and decoration alike.\\nReportedly, the colored dye used on these vases is quite expensive â€” it requires mixing molten iron with special sandstones, therefore making it a luxury to most. In Sumeru, the resulting bright red color has earned the title of \"Molten Sand.\"",
