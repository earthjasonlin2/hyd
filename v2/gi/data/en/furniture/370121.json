    "Name": "Valley Pavilion: Warm Daylight",
    "Desc": "A building built for taking in the scenery, supported by several pillars. It features an open design, allowing those within to drink in the landscapes on all four sides. In terms of design, while it varies from the water pavilion before Hezhe Post on Yilong Wharf, it achieves similarly stellar results.\\nReportedly, sailors from Fontaine refer to it as \"Lumidouce Longing,\" because the passage from the water pavilion in front of Yilong Wharf faces directly towards Lumidouce Harbor. Homesick Fontainian sailors will sometimes stand here, gazing out towards Lumidouce Harbor from afar. Fortunately, the voyage from Yilong Wharf back to Lumidouce is not terribly long, and the boundless hospitality of Yilong Wharf gives the sailors a feeling of comfort and cordiality, almost as though they had never left their homeland.",
