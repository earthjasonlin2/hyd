    "Name": "Snowman Nose: Touch Me!",
    "Desc": "A snowman nose made of stone. Can be used to build a Puffy Snowman.\\nSnowmen built near Dragonspine will sometimes be taken for enemies by Forest Boars who will charge and destroy them, much to the consternation of the children. In the process of this battle of wits, some children have chosen hard stones to use in making the snowmen's noses. This way, boars that charge them would get a face-full of stone for their trouble. This ultimately worked: Forest Boars today no longer charge snowmen with the impunity of yesteryear.",
