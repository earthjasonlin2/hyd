    "Name": "Sub-Space Boulder: Desert Wastes",
    "Desc": "After hearing about your experiences in the desert, Tubby designed this rock decoration based on her own imagination and Paimon's description. It resembles the actual landscape of the desert and can be used to form the basic terrain of adepti abodes.\\nThe sturdy and huge rock is like a lofty platform of sand. Its coarse surface shows the sustained effect of wind erosion over years.\\nIt is said that mercenaries who often walk in the desert can climb a rock like this unassisted, but they still need to be wary of the many sharp edges along its surface â€” one sloppy move and they will be left with bleeding wounds. These blade-like edges are vivid proof of the sandstorms' destructive power, and they also serve as a reminder of the impressive sturdiness of the Wall of Samiel.",
