    "Name": "Simulation Device: Ideal Accuracy",
    "Desc": "A simulation device modeled after the cityscapes of Fontaine. Created by the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol for training marksmen in musketry, or to attract potential talent.\\nLegend has it that the crackest of shots can achieve a dispersion of less than one arc minute at distances of over a thousand steps using precision-crafted muskets, requiring a training process that expends tons of ammunition. There is a saying that \"excellent marksmen are raised on a diet of bullets,\" indicating that the cost of cultivating such talent is astounding. The use of such devices ensures that the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol conducts effective training for marksmen while reducing the cost of training munitions.",
