    "Name": "War Drum: Line-Breaking Reverb",
    "Desc": "A war drum often found in military encampments, it has been made in a traditional style that has been passed down in Inazuma for centuries. The drumhead has the Sangonomiya emblem on it, but the sound it makes is identical to the ones used by the Shogunate. Even long-time drummers would not be able to tell the difference.\\nAmong the many strategies of the Sangonomiya resistance is the art of \"using identical drumbeats to disturb the Shogunate forces.\" Its uses are not many, but it certainly has turned the tide of battle before.",
