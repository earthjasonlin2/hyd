    "Name": "Area Marker: Downward",
    "Desc": "Signboards made of metal frames and durable Cypress Wood boards, featuring highly visible downward indicators, which can be seen in the Fortress of Meropide. It is said that upward signs are much more popular than their downward cousins. Perhaps this preference stems from a desire for the optimism of being released soon, but inmates whose sentences have not yet been served are well aware that their \"upward\" journey has limits.",
