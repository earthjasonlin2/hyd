    "Name": "Domed Wall: The Birds Sang",
    "Desc": "The walls of Sumeru Mansion: Meditative Retreat are lined with Brightwood that bears vine-shaped carvings, offering extra firmness and waterproofing. At times, flocks of birds may use these walls as a perch due to their unique design and sing, their birdsong weaving in and out of the wind that whistles through the gateway to form a mellifluous melody.",
