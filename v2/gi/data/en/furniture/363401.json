    "Name": "Teahouse Tool: Miniscule Misses Make a Mile",
    "Desc": "This sophisticated instrument is used in Chenyu Vale for the weighing of tea leaves. Its structure is simple enough, but it has incredible precision, to the point where the weight of even just a few tea leaves can be measured.\\nThey say that the high unit price of tea leaves makes merchants who come and go extremely sensitive to the weight of goods. To dispel such concerns, Chunming Teaworks will deliberately weigh the weight of each batch of tea leaves before and after drying and roasting, recording it on storage labels for easy verification. Aside from the experienced tea craftsmen who have been roasting tea for many years, not many can derive much information from such records. Still, the detailed data is symbolic of a rigorous attitude and an important process that cannot be neglected, as it leaves customers who purchase tea leaves doubly reassured.",
