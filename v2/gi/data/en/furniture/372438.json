    "Name": "Scarlet-Scented Fan Dance",
    "Desc": "A water plant that can sometimes be found in shallow seas. It resembles a folding fan, and its pinkish-red color remains exceedingly rich even after it has been dried, much like the flowing locks of the Divine Priestess. As such, some Watatsumi islanders and soldiers almost worship these plants and give them a wide berth. The Divine Priestess herself, however, personally considers such beliefs to be completely unnecessary.",
