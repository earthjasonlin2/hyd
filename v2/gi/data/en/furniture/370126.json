    "Name": "Valley Residence: Tranquility",
    "Desc": "These medium-sized residential buildings found in Yilong Wharf are so named because they are sandwiched between two tall gables, making them appear as though they were living in a valley of tranquility. This construction method is different from first erecting columns and then building walls, as it uses the already-built gables as the basis for its construction. Not only does this greatly reduce costs, but it also makes optimal use of the space between the two gables, killing two birds with one stone.",
