    "Name": "Pure Like Wheat Sprouts",
    "Desc": "A round carpet often seen in a Forest Ranger's tent. It is the color of wheat sprouts with neat patterns embroidered on top. However, these carpets are easily stained due to the fabric being relatively inexpensive. Some Forest Rangers believe this to be an asset, though â€” whenever they return from forest patrols, they will be reminded to remove their mud-covered boots and keep the rest of the room clean.",
