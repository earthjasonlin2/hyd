    "Name": "Sandy Domeshroom",
    "Desc": "These mushrooms have very thick caps that resemble the curved domes of some houses, which gives them their name. Their \"sandy-brown\" color is exceedingly eye-catching, which makes them an easy target for various animals visually. However, they have much harder caps to avoid being easy pickings â€” which, by the way, could really allow them to form a sturdy roof \"dome\" of sorts.",
