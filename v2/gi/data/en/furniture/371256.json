    "Name": "Valley Wall Corner: Like Gathering Waves",
    "Desc": "A courtyard wall structure that is often found at the corners, forming a connection between the two wall sections. It is said that the abundance of Chenyu Vale is due to the meandering waterways of the environment and that the ancestors saw the surging waves as symbols of stability, and the leaping fish as symbols of the fertility of the land. Thus the shapes of both waves and fish became common for walls. More than just decorations, they represent a desire for prosperity and calm.",
