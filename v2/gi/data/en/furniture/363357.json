    "Name": "\"Maison Cardinalice's Clerk\"",
    "Desc": "\"Clerk\" is an easy-to-operate clockwork meka with a refined design. All one needs do is slide in the paper, hit the keys, and the text appears on the page. Starting from the Palais Mermonia, they have spread to all over Fontaine. This meka has greatly improved the efficiency of writing, and sped up the progress of research projects and commercial activities alike. It's no exaggeration to say that these \"Clerks\" are among the primary catalysts for Fontaine's rapid progress.",
