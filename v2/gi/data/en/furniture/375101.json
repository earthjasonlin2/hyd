This Mondstadt-style luxury villa is very spacious, and when you sing out strong, the echoes will come back to you from all sides.\\nThese buildings are highly-complex constructions and are a rare sight in Mondstadt.\\nTubby explained its presence to you thusly: that Madame Ping had arranged for her to prepare this particular villa after hearing that a certain bard had visited another adeptus's abode recently.
