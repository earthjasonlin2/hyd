    "Desc": "A simple unadorned clay jar of rather rough make, and when compared to the public water point jar, this one has a lid on top as well, which prevents its contents from being contaminated by rainwater and dust.\\nSome mercenaries are used to gulping down wine over their long trek through the desert. Seeing this as an opportunity, the merchants offered them strong wine at a good price in such containers. Indeed, even well-known drinkers can be brought low with but 10 percent of this container's volume.",
