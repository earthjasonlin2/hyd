    "Name": "Abundance of Crisp Air",
    "Desc": "A commonly seen stall in Port Ormos with a frame built from sturdy Karmaphala Wood. The red cloth was created using the Akademiya's second generation light transmission technology, allowing it to let in varying amounts of sunlight during different times of the day. In addition, the cloth prevents the moisture inevitable in coastal areas from getting to the goods, while at the same time keeping the temperature in check even after prolonged periods of sunlight exposure. It is a convenient low-cost solution for long-term storage of goods.",
