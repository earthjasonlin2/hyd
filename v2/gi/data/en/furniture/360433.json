    "Desc": "A standard streetlight found in Fontainian cities that features a composite structure, combining a metallic outer shell with a core of Mallow Wood, ensuring both durability and cost-effectiveness. This allows a sufficient number of streetlights to be installed on every road, meeting the illumination requirements outlined in the Court of Fontaine Standards for Public Lighting. The modular design allowed the light sources to be easily swapped out as needed, accommodating future upgrades.",
