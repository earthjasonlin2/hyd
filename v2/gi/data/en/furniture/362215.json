    "Name": "Hatamoto Armor: Eijin Genkou",
    "Desc": "Traditional Inazuman armor displayed upon a rack in a sitting posture. These suits of armor still follow the classic forms used by hatamoto a century ago and are widely used by the Tenryou Commission, both for combat and ceremony.\\nIn a time before armor-making materials experienced a renaissance, the protective power of armor was balanced on a scale against its weight. Heavier armor provided more protection, yes, but it was a huge drain on the wearer's stamina and could not be put on quickly.\\nThe Shogun's army, equipped with such sturdy armor, was able to achieve battlefield superiority against the resistance for a time. Unfortunately, the samurai could not wear their armor indefinitely, and the resistance leadership caught on to the weaknesses in reaction and preparation time that these suits of armor imposed, engaging them with multiple forces on different fronts and using harassing tactics that forced the Shogunate forces many times into battles where there was no time to put their armor on. Subsequently, the Shogun's army also gradually switched to using lighter gear that allowed them to react quickly and engage the enemy flexibly.",
