    "Name": "Blooming Illumination",
    "Desc": "A magnificent lamp of the Grand Bazaar. Its petal-like double lampshade is painted soft, butterfly yellow and subdued azure, and its curves are multi-layered and demure. Thanks to its great height, which rivals even grown trees. The gentle light from these lamps can almost illuminate the entire hollow the Grand Bazaar is located in. They bring an elegant and calming feeling to the audience, and also make the dancers in the Zubayr Theater appear lighter and more airy.",
