    "Name": "Hued Vase: Sprout",
    "Desc": "A small and delicate clay vase that can be used for storing all kinds of beverages. During the crafting process, the surface is first coated with a clear porcelain white. Patterns are then painted on with a \"sprout green\" dye. Due to the simplicity of its shape and patterns, this vase requires little time to create, making it both suitable for mass production and easily affordable. However, its sales are limited by its narrow design which makes cleaning difficult. These vases are an uncommon sight compared to cylinder-shaped containers with larger openings.",
