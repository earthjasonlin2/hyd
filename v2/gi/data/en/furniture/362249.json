    "Name": "Tavern Dining Cart - \"A Snack Between Dishes\"",
    "Desc": "A small food cart often found beside customers at The Cat's Tail. It is one of the first pieces of furniture purchased and displayed by Margaret. In theory, the purpose of these carts is to hold food that can't fit on the table. However, the tables for customers are quite large and the cart is only needed when numerous patrons get together to order bottle after bottle of low-alcohol beverages and dish after dish of food as an accompaniment. As Margaret never intended The Cat's Tail to be a beer and wine dispensary, the cart was ultimately reused as a snack holder for Genius Invokation TCG players. However, in the heat of the match, players usually can't even think about eating, so most dishes laid upon the cart are cold platters.",
