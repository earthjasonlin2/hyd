    "Name": "Village Well: Underground Spring",
    "Desc": "A well commonly seen in the Inazuma countryside. It is equipped with a pulley mechanism for lifting and lowering buckets, making it easier to fetch water. This design was born out of objective conditions - the soil in some areas had been eroded by mysterious filth, and the wells in Inazuma were often dug to a surprising depth in order to obtain clean drinking water. Without the help of a pulley mechanism, it would have taken a great deal of physical strength to fetch water each time.",
