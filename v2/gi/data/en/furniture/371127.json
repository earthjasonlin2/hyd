    "Desc": "The fountain seen at the front entrance of the Akademiya. It is massive, with many metallic accessories attached to its edges, and there is a strong contrast between its light-gray and dark-gold hues. The shape of the fountain is exceedingly graceful. Like a blooming flower, water flows along conduits in the shape of petals, echoing and chiming as it falls. People will gradually feel more serene and clear-headed as they listen to this sound.",
