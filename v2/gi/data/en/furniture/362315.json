    "Name": "Fontainian Carpet: \"Fair and Square\"",
    "Desc": "This simple and plain square carpet has exquisite workmanship, with a wine-red base and carefully crafted gold scrollwork.\\nIt is said that in the design language of Fontaine, symmetrical patterns symbolize rationality while gold symbolizes solemnity and stability. Thus, carpets with golden patterns like this are often used in studies and areas where guests are received, to create an atmosphere of calm dignity.\\nAfter the Oratrice was built, symmetry also became a symbol of being just and fair, and so to this day many of these special kinds of golden patterns may be seen sewn into the carpets of the Opera Epiclese.",
