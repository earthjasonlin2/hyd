    "Desc": "A majestic and intricate meat barbecue with breathtakingly large capacity, able to cook enough meat for multiple tables. The vertical meat rack is quite unique, and can rotate slowly after turning on a switch, ensuring that the food will be cooked evenly. Experienced chefs can also alter the density of the ingredients according to the distribution of heat, chasing after that supreme, well-barbecued meat texture.",
