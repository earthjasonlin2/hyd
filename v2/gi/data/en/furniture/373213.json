    "Name": "Passage's Perfumed Potted Plants",
    "Desc": "The potted plants scattered throughout the Court of Fontaine are carefully selected by the city's maintenance staff in accordance with the Court of Fontaine Standards for Urban Decorative Plants. The staff specifically selected flower subspecies that were large and with distinctive aromas, after taking into consideration how their color palette would complement the aesthetics of their location. These plants are strategically placed at locations crucial to air circulation, allowing their light fragrances to swiftly permeate the city. As a result, the Court of Fontaine has received high praise from foreign gourmets critics who refer to it as \"a city of sensory pleasures.\" Some even attempted to commission a confectioner to create an oversized cake in the shape of the Court of Fontaine with the primary scents derived from extracts of these very flowers. Regrettably, the order was ultimately declined by the confectioner, who believed it would be \"a bad omen to devour the Court of Fontaine.\"",
