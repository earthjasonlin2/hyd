    "Desc": "A nose made using a small ball-shaped potato. Can be used to build a Puffy Snowman.\\nThese potato noses often wound up being stolen by starving Weasel Thieves, which led the children to add all kinds of odd flavorings to the potatoes, which caused them to become exceedingly bitter â€” a tart lesson indeed for these weaselly scoundrels.",
