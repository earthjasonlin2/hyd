    "Name": "Replica Ancient Otogi Keg",
    "Desc": "The casks made from Otogi Wood are similar in make to foreign products. \\nThe winemaking techniques of Inazuma are heavily influenced by those of Liyue, and traditional wines are usually made from ceramic pots and pots buried in the ground. After learning about winemaking techniques from other nations, Inazuma winemakers re-evaluated the cost and logistics of using the ceramic and large cellars to develop a cheaper, lighter cask to suit the needs of a receding economy.",
