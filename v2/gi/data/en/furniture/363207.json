    "Name": "The Essential Vase",
    "Desc": "A perfectly ordinary flower vase. Though it has been purchased by the Yashiro Commission and placed in a rather conspicuous place, its outward appearance and make are nothing special.\\nIn truth, this vase contains the implication of \"sticking to simplicity and doing one's basic job well.\" It also serves as encouragement to those who are temporarily facing tough times, reminding them that as long as they keep working hard, they can someday become outstanding, just like this vase.",
