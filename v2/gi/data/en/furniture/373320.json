    "Name": "Camp Barricade: Taking Sides",
    "Desc": "These barricades are in use by both the Shogun's army and the resistance forces. This blockade is more simply built than most, with an emphasis on the ability to quickly set it up. This is due to the fact that neither side can be considered to possess a glut of troops, and thus prefer to avoid costly battles of attrition. The main purpose of these barricades is to highlight the presence of borders and fortifications to disrupt enemy tactics, making it equivalent to a chess piece with which generals engage in psychological warfare.",
