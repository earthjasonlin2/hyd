    "Name": "Of Fields Green: Kitty Waiter",
    "Desc": "A road sign in the garden known as \"Of Fields Green.\" It is made using a straight shrub carved in the playful image of a cat taking a deferential stance even as a waiter might.\\n\"Of Fields Green\" draws inspiration from wonderlands in fairy tales. These cat waiters present an invitation at the behest of the Queen of Wonderland to children at key moments in the story. As such, these road signs are often placed near important landmarks, their presence bearing extraordinary weight indeed.",
