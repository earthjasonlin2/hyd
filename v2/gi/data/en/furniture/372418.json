    "Name": "Green Pearlroot Tree",
    "Desc": "Save for certain trees with special nobility, the people of Liyue are more used to naming vegetation based on their morphology as opposed to their precise species. Thus, it was to these trees with pale branches that they gave the name \"Pearlroot.\"\\nNo sharp blade or axe is necessary to cut the branches of this tree down, which has led to it being used by many adventurers to make various basic tools.",
