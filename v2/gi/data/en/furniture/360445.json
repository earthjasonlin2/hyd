    "Name": "Artisan Fish Lantern: Spring Profits",
    "Desc": "These small carp lanterns are quite light and can be seen everywhere in Chenyu Vale.\\nUnlike the large fish lanterns used for display, some small ones are used primarily for carp lantern dances. Performers will visit the homes of villagers and perform spring dances holding said lanterns to wish the inhabitants a happy and fortuitous new year, and the recipient will repay the well-wishers for their blessings with benefits. Thus comes the saying that benefits bring the start of spring. Small fish lanterns that are fixed in place, however, carry the meaning of good omens that will remain in place for a long time.",
