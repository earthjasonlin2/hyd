    "Name": "Simple Lighting: \"Locally Sourced Materials\"",
    "Desc": "A type of wind-resistant metal lamp often seen in the Fleuve Cendre that is primarily constructed from recycled metal and old clockwork meka parts. Though they are vastly inferior to the standard street lamps of the Court of Fontaine in both appearance and lighting performance, they are far cheaper. As for their lifespan, the residents of the Fleuve Cendre are even less concerned, for within the sewers, there is no shortage of replacement parts...",
