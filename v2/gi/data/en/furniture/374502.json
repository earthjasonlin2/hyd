    "Name": "Foundations of Stone: Timely Arrival",
    "Desc": "A pavement created using dense stones. These stones are arranged rather flexibly and are suited for paving roads where load-bearing requirements are not too stringent.\\nThe clean, hard stones utilize a traditional art from Liyue that melts and melds smashed stone and sand grains together to form slabs that are sturdy, long-lasting, and inexpensive, thus making them much sought after across the continent.\\nAccessibility is not merely the keystone of mercantile development, but it is also how those who live in even the most remote places may seek a new life and new opportunities.",
