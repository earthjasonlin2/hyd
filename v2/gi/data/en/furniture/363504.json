    "Name": "The Art of Retaining Water",
    "Desc": "A potted plant that's said to be both \"interesting and appropriately aggressive\". The plant is a desert specialty with needles densely arranged across its succulent flesh. Thanks to the needles, the water-rich plant is kept safe from being eaten by wild animals.\\nThe plant teaches a simple lesson: the importance of deploying armed guards at water sources. Whenever someone brings up the topic of reducing the budget for armed personnel — whether it be in a desert settlement or a division of the Eremites — the leaders of the guards will carry a thorny plant like this one and make those in the room see reason.",
