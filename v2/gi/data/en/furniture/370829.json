    "Name": "\"Resourceful Residence in the Musicmaking Town\"",
    "Desc": "A plain-looking standalone building with ample internal space that is well-suited for the long-term residence of one or two people, and one of the most common buildings within Petrichor. It is said that most buildings in Petrichor utilize wave-shaped roofs. Such designs help excess rainwater drain off the roof via the eaves on one hand, while on the other, it expands the living space within. Two birds with one stone.",
