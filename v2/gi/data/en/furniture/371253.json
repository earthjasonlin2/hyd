    "Name": "Valley Gate: Bustling Yard",
    "Desc": "A type of courtyard wall commonly seen in Yilong Wharf. It has a wide entrance and its sturdy stone structure is supplemented by Sandbearer Wood, giving it a majestic beauty. To meet the logistical requirements of most customers, the dimensions of the gate are large enough to allow a large cart to pass through. \"Effort required to push open the gate\" has become a sort of standard to assess the strength of hired guards.",
