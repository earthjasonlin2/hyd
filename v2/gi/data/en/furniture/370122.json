    "Name": "Valley Stone Archway: Recurring Omen of Abundance",
    "Desc": "An elegant memorial archway with three gates and four pillars that gives off an aura of solemnity and spiritual power, often seen in Yilong Wharf.\\nThe people of Liyue say that \"Good things come in pairs\" and so the road is divided into two directions, and thus \"good things come and go.\" But such an arch with three gates not only has the symbolism of a \"Bountiful Year,\" but also follows \"The Rule of Three.\"\\nRegardless, it represents an auspicious omen for those who pass by.",
