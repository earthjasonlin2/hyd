    "Name": "Teahouse Bench: Simple Seating",
    "Desc": "A simple stool made from affordable Sandbearer Wood, oft found in Chunming Teaworks. While the appearance and comfort of its seating are unremarkable, these lightweight, portable stools are, in fact, more suitable for the working environment inside a tea house as opposed to regular chairs that take up excessive floor space, with the frequent movement of personnel and the frequent changes in workstations granting them superior practicality. During mealtime, they can be pulled conveniently over to a table, creating a lively and convivial atmosphere as craftsmen from different tea houses gather around, chatting and enjoying their meals.",
