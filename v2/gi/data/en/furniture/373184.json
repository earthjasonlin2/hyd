    "Name": "Cleverly Crafted Cauldron: Potion Plans Aplenty",
    "Desc": "A key device in the alchemy store that, with the expertise lent by Albedo and Sucrose, maintains a magnificent appearance and all the functionality of an alchemy cauldron while being more user-friendly (especially to less experienced alchemists) and more internally spacious, allowing for mass production to take place. This is the gift the Honorary Knight received in thanks for their aid in managing the alchemy store.\\nIt is said that this cauldron's greatest advantage is the rate at which it can accelerate the fusion and transmutation of ingredients, thus shortening the potion manufacturing cycle. However, this also makes it unsuited as a tea-making or cooking implement. After all, you wouldn't call a bottle of highly concentrated ingredients a gourmet meal... would you?",
