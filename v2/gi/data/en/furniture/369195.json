    "Name": "Young Alpaca: Chocolate",
    "Desc": "These floofy, furry four-legged camelids are elegant and gentle, and get along very well with humans, just like good partners who understand one another...\\nThis particular Alpaca sports a deep, chocolate-brown coat, reputed to be the strongest and most explosive of its kind, often serving as the leader or guardian within Alpaca herds. Upon entering The Realm Within, the usually gentle chocolate-colored beasts exhibited noticeably defensive behavior towards canine creatures, leaving the latter disheartened for a while. Fortunately, over time, the chocolate-colored leaders eventually incorporated the canines into their herd, fulfilling their desire to play together.",
