    "Name": "\"Courier's Timely Dispatch\"",
    "Desc": "A peculiarly designed wooden mailbox, primarily used for collecting various letters, featuring circular openings large enough for objects the size of Flamegranates, found near the Courier's Longhouse.\\nIt is said that during the years of repelling the Abyssal invasion, the \"Scions of the Canopy\" urgently needed a device that was easy to fabricate, with abundant raw materials, and stable in rigorous conditions. The abundant Flamegranate shells left on the battlefield became the ideal material. Tested through frequent jolting and harsh environments, these \"devices\" proved their outstanding durability, evolving into the widely used package carriers in Natlan today.",
