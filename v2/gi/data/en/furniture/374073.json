    "Name": "Wood-Carved Eyes: Say That Again, I Dare You",
    "Desc": "A pair of enraged wood-carved eyes that can be used to assemble an \"Aranara Carving.\"\\nIt was modeled after the eyes of the Eremite captain Feroz in Port Ormos. Parents in Port Ormos always tell their children to stay away from Feroz, lest they pick up any of his foul language. Nevertheless, such restrictions have instead triggered the youngsters' curiosity, tremendously increasing Feroz's popularity among them â€” him and his malicious eyes both.",
