    "Name": "Dripping Verdant Light",
    "Desc": "A twin-model streetlamp that is suitable for being placed in the many varied environments that one may encounter in the rainforest. The lamp pole adopts a spliced design. By adjusting the angle between the two lamp-pole sections, the height of the whole streetlamp can be changed to stop them from being blocked by either branches or rocks. The lamps hanging at the end of the poles are filled with phosphorescent plant parts that have mild colors and which are safe and stable, thus making the lamps easy to maintain.",
