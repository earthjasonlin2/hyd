    "Name": "Wood-Carved Hat: Merchant",
    "Desc": "An exquisite and gorgeous wood-carved hat that can be used to assemble an \"Aranara Carving.\"\\nIt was modeled after the hat of a certain traveling merchant. That central blue decorative piece sure looks pricey, but is in fact a mere dyed stone. Even so, any woodcarving wearing such a hat would appear much more regal and extravagant.",
