    "Name": "Liyue House: Time Waits for No One",
    "Desc": "A two-story Liyue-style house. The bottom floor can be used as a shop, while the owner stays on top.\\nDiligence is key when it comes to running a small business, and business-people tend to rise early and go to bed late, so they often feel the need to stay close to their workplace. Thus, this particular integrated shophouse design can be seen just about anywhere in Liyue.\\nIt is said that the current Tianshu once lived and toiled in just such a shophouse before his rise and that he used to galvanize himself with the following phrase: \"time waits for no one.\"",
