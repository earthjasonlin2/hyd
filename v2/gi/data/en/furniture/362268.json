    "Name": "Fair's Fresh Vegetables",
    "Desc": "A simple and lightweight shelf made from Ashen Aratiku Wood used to store fresh fruits and vegetables, often found in Chuwen Fair. They say that because the Stadium of the Sacred Flame hosts people from all the tribes, stores tend to focus on \"abundant variety\" rather than \"abundant amounts\" such that they might cater to the different living habits and tastes in food. The shelves, consequently, are lightweight and portable, prioritizing the display of as many types of goods as possible, minimizing excess inventory and waste.",
