    "Name": "Desert Hut: Wilting",
    "Desc": "A hut that may be found in Aaru Village. Its structure is quite simple and the materials required to build are also quite easy to collect. Its frame is made from leftover house-building materials, the roof is made from low-value hay, and it can be erected in merely half a day.\\nAt first, few people were particularly picky about what hay they used in making roofs, and it was not until several incidents in which \"an unattended Sumpter Beast made a meal out of someone's roof\" occurred that people began to specifically use completely dried out grasses to make roofs â€” and raise the standards of Sumpter Beast feed, just in case.",
