    "Name": "\"Ballad-Spinning Windwheel\"",
    "Desc": "The windwheel is emblematic of Mondstadt. Its giant arms turn in response to the wind, generating ample energy.\\nHaving read some Snezhnayan literature on the topic, one alchemist thinks that it may well be possible to store the energy generated by windmills using a mechanism fashioned from a combination of Pyro and Electro slimes. But even if his experiment were to succeed, the Knights of Favonius would never allow such a dangerous plan to proceed.",
