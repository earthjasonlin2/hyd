    "Name": "\"Tea Harvest's Fishery Inspiration\"",
    "Desc": "A bamboo basket woven from tough and lightweight Bamboo Segments that is commonly used for storing freshly harvested tea leaves. Thanks to its ingenious design, this basket type is convenient to lift and transport, and thus it is greatly favored by tea farmers.\\nIt is said that the practice of storing tea leaves in bamboo baskets may have been inspired by fisherfolk using similar items to transport fish. These baskets are woven from sturdy bamboo strips that are not only durable but also capable of maintaining the freshness of one's catch. Tea farmers observed this characteristic, drew inspiration from it, and devised a diverse range of bamboo implements specifically designed for storing tea leaves.",
