    "Name": "Pink Torso: Wise Elder",
    "Desc": "A woodcarving torso with a stick that can be used to assemble an \"Aranara Carving.\" It is painted pink and reminds people of huge flowers in full bloom.\\nNo fairy tale is complete without an Aranara elder. Like a giant tree in the forest, they use their wisdom to protect the little ones from the wind and rain. Most of them are amiable figures with a stick, who stroke their beards as they tell stories within stories.",
