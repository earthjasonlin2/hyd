    "Name": "\"Sneku's Thicket\"",
    "Desc": "A long sofa found in The Cat's Tail. Colored with the green found between the mountains and the woods, this sofa has a freshness akin to the feeling when one returns to nature. The main reason behind the use of these colors is because Sneku the duel cat often likes playing outdoors, and constantly yearns to frolic around in the free wilderness...\\nIn reality, however, the inhabitants of the woods were not nearly as pliable to Sneku's demands as the cards are. After a failed attempt at issuing a command, Sneku fled into the shrubbery to avoid potential mistreatment by the riled inhabitants. Henceforth, all items and materials with the same coloring as woodland greenery instill an additional sense of safety in Sneku.",
