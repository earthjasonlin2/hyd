    "Name": "\"The Five Kasen\" Nishiki-e",
    "Desc": "An elaborate folding screen based on the display board at the Magnificent Irodori Festival. It features portraits of present-day people modeled after the legend of \"The Five Kasen.\" The original is currently stored in the collection of the Yashiro Commission. The scrolls on the display board are the devoted works of \"Mr. Calx,\" and they seem to hide secrets that the craftsmen cannot reproduce.\\nThese portraits were once displayed in the \"The Five Kasen\" square of the Irodori Festival, and as the festival progressed, each portrait was revealed one by one, in the order of \"Suikou,\" \"Aoi no Okina,\" \"Akahito,\" \"Sumizome,\" and \"Kuronushi.\" This folding screen, which was brought back by the Traveler as a souvenir to the Realm Within, reveals four of the portraits, recounting the clever intersection of ancient legends and present-day events.",
