    "Name": "Wading Stones",
    "Desc": "Flat stones, one high and one low, that form what seems to be a natural step-way.\\nIn the past, the fisherpeople of Inazuma would not only go out to snag a catch, but would also head to sea often to plant seagrass in the shallows and rear crabs. These stones would be placed in shoals to give these people a more stable footing and prevent them from being all too easily washed away by sudden large waves.",
