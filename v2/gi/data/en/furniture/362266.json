    "Name": "Hotel Railing: \"Perfect Viewing Arc\"",
    "Desc": "An exquisite curved railing made from high-quality Cypress Wood that is very pleasing to the eye. It looks like the railings found in the Hotel Debord.\\nIn the designer's own words, using an arcing design like this is primarily to give guests a wider field of view, enabling them to enjoy performances up close. However, compared to straight railings, curved designs are harder to build, and are much more expensive to maintain. Thus, they are not often found outside of the Hotel Debord.",
