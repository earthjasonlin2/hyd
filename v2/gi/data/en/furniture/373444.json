    "Name": "Banquet Screen: Crying Swallows and Chirping Sparrows",
    "Desc": "This delicate, quaint, and propitious folding screen uses precious Sandbearer Wood as the core around which the finest brocade is wrapped, and can be seen around Liyue during Lantern Rite.\\nThe brocade on the screen depicts a scene showing the world coming back to life with the coming of spring, the scissor-tailed swallow and the sparrow singing in harmony. According to legend, this scene was painted at the interstice of winter and spring, and the painter imbued it with their hopes for clement weather, peace, and an auspicious new year. No matter when or where, beautiful wishes are the best gift, and during a festive season, such wishes embroider the festival with a radiant rainbow of joy.",
