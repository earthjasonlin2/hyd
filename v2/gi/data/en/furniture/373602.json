    "Name": "Shaded Clarity",
    "Desc": "A masterpiece created by the Sumeru Fishing Association. After being replicated using adeptal energies, it serves the same functions as a \"Pool of Sapphire Grace.\"\\nFramed with top-quality Adhigama Wood, this fish tank is made of transparent glass and wooden panels with unique patterns. Its extremely extraordinary size can easily accommodate multiple large Ornamental Fish inside. Word has it that a certain senior angler spent a fortune on the tank so as to better appreciate the magnificent fish he had caught. Experts were specially hired to design the tank, the making of which even utilized Fontaine's most advanced technologies to fashion the tank out of a single piece of glass. Two pieces of curved glass bent at different angles were then used to form the sides of the fish tank, such that the size of the fish inside might be optically shrunk, allowing onlookers to move their eyes less when admiring his beloved fish.\\nIt's just that such large pieces of glass are of fairly limited strength. Therefore, it would be unwise to tamper with the irritable kinds inside the fish tank, such as Betta, or else you will probably have to spend the whole day rescuing the dying fish, picking up glass shards, and cleaning up the floor.",
