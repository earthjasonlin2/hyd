    "Name": "Courtyard Pavilion: Amidst the Rivers",
    "Desc": "This pavilion comes adorned with indigo-green tiles, intricate golden ornaments, and pillars carved of stone, all seamlessly integrated for a harmonious aesthetic. Considering that Fontaine-style courtyard architecture often incorporates \"flowing water\" or \"fountains\" as primary decorative elements, a typical pavilion may dazzle overmuch if reflected upon the water's surface. By contrast, a pavilion that utilizes natural stone colors is bright and cool in such lighting conditions, providing just the right sort of visual appeal.",
