    "Desc": "A round bamboo sieve made from light yet resilient Bamboo Segments. Its primary usage lies in storing them within for drying or cooling of tea leaves, making it a common sight in Chenyu Vale.\\nIt is said that the process of cooling comes from a day long ago when a tea farmer accidentally discovered that a different fragrance was produced when dried out tea leaves were given some time to rest. As such, after much careful experimentation and refinements, the cooling process was eventually ascertained to be a complementary part of processing certain tea varieties.",
