    "Name": "Snowboar",
    "Desc": "A forest boar that makes its home in cold climates, with thicker fur than its warmer climate cousins. \\nAccording to scientists, although the cold, frosty conditions of its habitat required a stubborn ability to survive, it also provided an environment without any natural predators, allowing Snowboars to multiply in number unhindered. Legends say that Snowboars can live for an incredibly long time, even allowing it to grow abnormally large during such a long battle for survival. As adventurers explore deeper into Dragonspine, they seem to rediscover this species that was previously thought extinct. \\nIn the more temperate climate of the Realm Within, the fur of the Snowboars are so thick that they will get too hot after light physical exertion.",
