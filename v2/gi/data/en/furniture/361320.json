    "Name": "Spirit of the Banquet",
    "Desc": "A long rectangular table often seen in the restaurants, taverns, and cafes of Sumeru City. The spacious tabletop made from sturdy Karmaphala Wood can accommodate a large group of patrons, and is a great choice for dining out with friends. Even after plates of barbecued meat, bowls of food, flagons of alcohol, and large cups of beverages have all been placed on the table, there is still plenty of space left for guests to converse, gesture, and laugh.",
