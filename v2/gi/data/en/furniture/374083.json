    "Name": "Wood-Carved Hat: Diviner",
    "Desc": "A wood-carved hat with a conical crown and a wide brim that can be used to assemble an \"Aranara Carving.\"\\nIt was modeled after the hat of a traveling astrologist in Mondstadt. Like other nations, Sumeru also has a custom of performing divination. However, Sumeru must be too lush a place for the stars above to be observed, for the residents here have turned to coffee grounds and leftover tea leaves for divination. Well then, there must also be fortune-tellers amongst the Aranara who can perform divination by observing the veins of leaves, right?",
