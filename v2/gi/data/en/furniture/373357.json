    "Name": "The Eremites' Flame of Vigor",
    "Desc": "An iron rack on which the campfire is lit. Properly-dried Adhigama Wood is used to keep the fire burning brightly for a long time.\\n\"Only valor's flame shall never be extinguished.\"\\nSuch is the proverb that circulates among mercenaries, and you can often find those with a romantic disposition reciting this line to others. Although frustration is inevitable in a warrior's journey, the sight of the flaming campfire can rekindle their will to fight. Therefore, mercenary groups treat camping and fire-building as the top priority in campaigns.\\nSimilarly, putting out hostile units' campfires is also an effective way to demoralize them, especially when it comes to particularly obdurate foes. Rumors have it that a mercenary with long, black-and-golden hair once broke into her enemy's camp single-handedly and put out all their campfires. She thus vanquished her enemy, bringing the battle to an early end and avoiding unnecessary casualties.",
