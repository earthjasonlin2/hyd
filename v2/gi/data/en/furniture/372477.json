    "Name": "Sunset Reflection",
    "Desc": "This plant with burning red leaves was given the name \"Sunset Reflection\" by some researchers, but in fact, these plants aren't very special at all â€” their medicinal and functional values are both close to none. A few mercenaries make pressed bookmarks out of their leaves and keep them with other leaf specimens, comparing them to the color of the sky to determine the time of day when there's no better way to keep track of time.",
