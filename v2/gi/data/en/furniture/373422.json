    "Name": "A Painting Left For You",
    "Desc": "\"Mamere and her good friends!\" \\nMamere drew this other painting for you and Paimon, showing \"friends\" being happy together.\\nDuring your brief parting, Mamere has been busy studying different painting styles. This, then, is the result of many attempts and iterations and is her greatest pride and joy. It won't sell for 500,000 Mora or anything like that, nor can it be easily called \"beautiful,\" but to Mamere, there is no price to be put on this depiction of her and three people (who aren't \"people,\" exactly) of unparalleled importance to her â€” surely, such a thing must be beautiful.",
