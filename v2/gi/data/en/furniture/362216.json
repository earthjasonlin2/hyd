    "Name": "Yumemiru \"Jukaku\" Folding Screen",
    "Desc": "A folding screen made beautifully using Yumemiru Wood. The painting displayed on this screen is the classic \"Heron's Plume.\" Such was the striking realism in this work that if the artwork was too far away, and the environment too dim, some people might even hallucinate and think themselves able to walk into the painted scene, only to hit the folding screen head-on. In weary response, the artisans responsible changed the configuration of the folding screen such that it would have one small lantern on either side of it. This was originally a safety measure, but one supposes that it couldn't hurt that this also made the painting appear more elegant.",
