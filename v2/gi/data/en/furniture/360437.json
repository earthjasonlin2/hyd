    "Name": "Meka Luminaire: Shining Sea",
    "Desc": "A standard Fontainian coastal street light often found lining the paths in areas such as the Opera Epiclese and Romaritime Harbor. Unlike the standard street lights used in the Court of Fontaine, this street light uses stronger materials, and its relatively shorter and solid pole is better able to resist the erosive properties of the noticeably salty sea winds by the coast. But even with its special design, these street lights require much more frequent maintenance than their counterparts in the Court of Fontaine.",
