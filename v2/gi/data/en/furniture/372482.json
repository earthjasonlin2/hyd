    "Name": "Halted Spoondrift",
    "Desc": "A shrub with many layers of leaves that spread out like the spray of foam that jets out of the ocean when a gem is hurled in. Thus does it embody the artist's dream, to capture a moment in brush strokes. But to create the color of this shrub places rather stringent demands upon an artist's grasp of color, technique, and the make of the pigment.",
