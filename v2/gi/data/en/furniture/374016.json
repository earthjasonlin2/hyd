    "Name": "Snowman Hat: Hair Care",
    "Desc": "A hat with three locks of hair. Can be used to build a Puffy Snowman.\\nUsually, snowman hats of this kind are souvenirs made using dyed hair taken from pets. Children often forget themselves while making snowmen, even staying out past midnight. Some adults have taken a more firm hand in such matters, piling up snowmen of their own before sticking these souvenirs on the snowmen's heads and telling the children \"if you sleep too late, your hair will fall out just like this snowman's.\" Surprisingly, this tactic has proved rather effective.",
