    "Name": "Festive Fragrance: Of Gold and Jade",
    "Desc": "An elegant folding screen that is made from the cores of somewhat-older Sandbearer Wood. The scarlet-tinted surface has a light fragrance. The fabric of the screen itself is satin-soft and splendidly embroidered with clusters of golden flowers, presenting the right path to riches â€” that is to say that all goods, whether in appearance or substance, must be as perfect as pure gold. This is a principle that Liyue's merchants have followed since the very beginning.",
