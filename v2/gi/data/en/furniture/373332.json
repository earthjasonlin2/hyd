    "Name": "\"Henji\" Aralia Noticeboard",
    "Desc": "A common notice board found in Inazuma City. At first, the board's published notices and commercial advertisements were very serious. However, their dire nature could not hold the attention of passers-by, and some felt that they were not effective at getting their message across. \\nSo a young official in the Shogunate, who was deeply influenced by the Yae Publishing House's works, suggested that people be allowed to leave messages on the notice board to drive up interest. It worked. As it turned out, people often enjoy leaving messages after eating and drinking in the city, and the interest in the notice boards increased dramatically, thus allowing more serious messages to reach more of the city.",
