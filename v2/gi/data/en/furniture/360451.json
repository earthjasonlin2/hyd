    "Name": "Glowing Forest Fruit",
    "Desc": "A peculiar lamp that can be found within the Forest of Blessings. The inspiration for its design is rumored to have come from a fairy tale named \"Lamp-Tree.\" As a result, these lamps give the overall impression of a massive flower, with a purple lampshade like a coiled corolla and the lamp within like a budding fruit. This distinctive design takes both aesthetic and practical illumination requirements into account, effectively preventing night-flying accidents as well as ensuring that animals do not get lost in the dark.",
