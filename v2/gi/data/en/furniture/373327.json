    "Name": "Shrine Statue: \"Seirai Ward\"",
    "Desc": "The statue, which can be seen near Asase Shrine in Seirai Island, resembles a giant cat, but there are some indistinguishable features that give this statue a different kind of majesty.\\nSome ancient books and light novels believe in the unverified folklore and call this statue \"Komainu,\" identifying it as a divine beast with great power. Neko, \"Provisional Head Priestess of the Asase Shrine\" is extremely puzzled by this: \"A cat is a cat. Do mortals not recognize a cat just because it's adorned, meow?\"",
