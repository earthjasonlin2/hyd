    "Name": "Floral Arrangement: \"Art of Contrast\"",
    "Desc": "A sizable floral arrangement in a large floor vase that is often used to decorate important venues. The color combination adopted by this floral arrangement is relatively cool when compared to the bright colors usually popular in Fontaine. A reporter during an exhibition once remarked, \"A floral decoration like this, one that can blend into the surroundings like leaves, is the perfect complement to accentuate the vase's elegance.\" But no one knows for sure whether or not this remark was influenced by the sponsor of the exhibition, a distributor of vases.",
