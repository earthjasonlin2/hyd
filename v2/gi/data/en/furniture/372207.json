    "Name": "Goldchime Stone",
    "Desc": "A claim originating from the Blackcliff Forge holds that this giant stone contains a great quantity of gold inside, and that \"If you hit it with a hammer, it chimes like a bell.\" Hence the name, \"Goldchime Stone.\" The more ubiquitous theory is that it is no different from any other stone.\\nAn investigation by the Ministry of Civil Affairs found that the source of the rumor was a work song written by miners to boost their morale. Somewhere along the line, the song's meaning was misconstrued and many people ended up believing the lyrics to be true.",
