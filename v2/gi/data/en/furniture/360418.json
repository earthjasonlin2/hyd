    "Name": "Stoneworks Lamp: Deeping-Gloom Candle",
    "Desc": "A hand lantern that may be found in The Chasm that contains ores that glow with a pale blue light, thus precluding the need for any flammable materials to help it light the way. It is less bright, however, and so it does take some getting used to. However, it is said that veteran miners can use their dim, cool gleam to find exposed ore.",
