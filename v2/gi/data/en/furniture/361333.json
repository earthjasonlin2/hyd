    "Desc": "A long cut-away table that can be found in Fontaine, made from Cypress Wood. The designer used a bold cut-away design, and packed multiple layers of wax at the edges to brace against possible impact, thus reducing the risk of people being injured by the table corners, and also extending the table's shelf life, a feature that succeeds in accomplishing multiple purposes. It is well-suited for restaurants that host large numbers of people, or families with playful children.",
