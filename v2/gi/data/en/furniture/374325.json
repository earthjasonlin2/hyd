    "Name": "Joyous Forest Party",
    "Desc": "A small floor table made of sturdy stone and fabric with a unique texture that is commonly seen in the Forest of Blessings. The most notable design feature of this little table is that it has no legs, and is thus much lower than most others. Not only does the lack of legs improve its longevity, but it also helps with withstanding impacts from paper frogs and flying squirrels as well as thoughtfully accommodate the greatly varying body size of the inhabitants of the Forest. Even the largest, floofiest paper alpaca or the smallest, chubbiest hamster can both play at such a table, enjoying a joyous time together.",
