    "Name": "\"Green Fountain\"",
    "Desc": "A plant with especially verdant foliage found all over Teyvat.\\nLegend says its roots run exceptionally deep, allowing it to draw water from far below the surface and get rid of harmful substances, and also making it a natural reservoir of water. For this reason, adventurers who often mash up the leaves to extract drinking water have given it the name \"Green Fountain.\"\\nBranch Master Cyrus, however, cautions the younger generation against simply chewing the leaves, as they are bitter, spicy, and may harm the throat.",
