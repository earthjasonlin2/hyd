    "Name": "Bookshelf: Speedy Browsing",
    "Desc": "A medium-sized bookshelf made of durable Cypress Wood â€” a common public utility in Fontaine.\\nAs time marched on, bookshelves with casually placed books stopped being able to meet the demands of the growing number of avid readers in Fontaine. At the same time, the diverse content of newspapers and periodicals also required new classification methods. Therefore, the administrators of Fontaine arranged for specialists to study the key points of the \"rapid classification of news article themes,\" with the result being this three-layer book and newspaper reading shelf. They also adopted the latest classification principle: the most prominent place belongs to The Steambird and its subsidiaries, while other spots are freely allocated according to demand. After all, both the bookshelf and the research costs were borne by The Steambird.",
