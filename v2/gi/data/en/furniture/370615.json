    "Desc": "To the ordinary folk of Inazuma, this building, made in the style of the Outlander Affairs Agency complex, would be of particular height indeed.\\nIt is said that the Kanjou Commission constructed the Outlander Affairs Agency complex in this manner as a way of displaying Inazuma's glory to guests from abroad. To this day, not a single merchant from Ritou does not dwell in its shadow.\\nHowever, its role in the Serenitea Pot is purely cosmetic. Paimon suggests that you can use the awesome view to give your guests a show!",
