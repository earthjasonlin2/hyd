    "Name": "Inazuman Mansion: As One",
    "Desc": "A more expansive Inazuman dwelling that has the same design as the Police Station. It is a newer construction and thus features a composite structure with higher towers.\\nThe Police Station was already built on high ground, so one could look out from its upper floors to view all of Hanamizaka. Doushin stationed in the towers themselves are thus well-placed to deal with any sudden happenings in the city grounds.\\nHowever, some citizens resented this feeling of being constantly watched and would submit petitions to the station. Moreover, few cases had ever happened in the city in the first place, so the tower guards were ultimately dissolved.",
