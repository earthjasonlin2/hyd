    "Name": "\"Legion's Furious Horns\"",
    "Desc": "A finely designed model horn adorned with metallic decorations on the body that give it an abnormally luxurious appearance. It is the same design as the horn model found in the Faded Castle.\\nIt is said that in the past, the sound of the horn was deep and resounding, like the furious roars of wild beasts, and was therefore used to express battle scenes. Today, a variety of instruments are used for this purpose, and this majestic instrument has gradually been reduced to being an iconic symbol.",
