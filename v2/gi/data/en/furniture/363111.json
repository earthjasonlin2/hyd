    "Name": "Listening Candlelight",
    "Desc": "A stone lampstand often seen in Aaru Village. It has two structures shaped like a wolf's ears, as if the vase is listening to the sounds around it. The section holding the candle has a unique shape and is said to amplify people's voices â€” should they approach an area with this lampstand while conversing loudly, they will be reminded by its resounding echoes to kindly lower their voices and avoid disturbing others.",
