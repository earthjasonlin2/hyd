    "Name": "Fair's Splendid Textiles",
    "Desc": "A stone cabinet placed in the Stadium of the Sacred Flame that displays exquisitely patterned and brightly colored textiles. Thanks to its well-considered space design, this stone cabinet not only showcases fabrics in all their loveliness but also utilizes natural ventilation to help keep the fabrics dry and prevent mold from setting in. This makes it ideal both as a display case for vendors and as a storage cabinet for personal use. However, its heavier weight limits its usage to locations with ample space and fixed setups, such as the Adventurers' Guild and the Weary Inn.",
