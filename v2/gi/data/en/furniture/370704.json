    "Name": "Deepwood Dweller's Perseverance",
    "Desc": "Compact, lightweight huts that can be carried away by powerful adults with one hand, or even strapped to their backs. The trade-off, of course, is that such tents are only waterproof for a short time. The structure is not very strong, and a small collision from a common wild animal or even a bird leaping from the treetops might break it apart. Only the most daring adventurers would dare to spend the night alone in such a tent like a sellsword on a brief stay in the rainforest. Mercenaries are usually hardy and carry dry food with them, and do not care about the difficulty of storing supplies in the tents.",
