    "Desc": "A pagoda from Sumeru Mansion: Meditative Retreat built around a thriving giant tree. The crown of the tree and its flowers are exceedingly large and can be seen from hundreds of meters away, emitting a calming and serene feeling. As a structure, it appears as something like a unique signifier, silently constraining visitors' actions and reminding them that they have stepped into the realm of silent meditation.",
