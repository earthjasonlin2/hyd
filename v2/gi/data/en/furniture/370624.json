    "Desc": "Scarlet-painted Yumemiru Wood was used in the creation of this shrine hall, and it greatly resembles the one in the Grand Narukami Shrine.\\nPeople all say that offering Mora into the Offering Box after praying earnestly will grant you a more efficacious reply. In all seriousness, though, Mora likely doesn't count as a high-priority item for the Electro Archon, even if she could hear all of the prayers people say in their hearts. Nor does the Shrine need their donations, having an independent and steady source of income as it does.",
