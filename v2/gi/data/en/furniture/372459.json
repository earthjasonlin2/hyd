    "Desc": "\"If you remove the thick outer skins of vividly-colored plants, you can get some sweet fruit, but there is a measure of poison in such fruits, and they are as such not to be consumed in large amounts.\"\\nThis is how the latest matra operating manuals describe these desert shrubs.\\nNo matter how strong someone's will is, it is still possible that they might let their guard down around such sweet fruit after bearing the twin torments of inclement weather and a long journey for too long. The manuals also contain detailed tutorials on how to use other desert plants to neutralize these poisons, should an inexperienced matra err in this regard.",
