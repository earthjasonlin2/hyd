    "Desc": "This exquisite and unique stall is positioned near the Test of Courage run by the Yashiro Commission. It is said that under the management of an experienced shopkeeper, one can partake in an improved version of a traditional game. A variety of colorful balloons will be left to float across shallow waters, each containing a small reward within. Whoever can use the thin paper nets in the water to collect the balloon can claim the prizes they bear.\\nIt takes a special kind of skill to draw in heavier objects without causing the paper netting to tear, so while those possessing the needed dexterous mastery might get rewards, newcomers will often find themselves empty-handed. Of course, no one should be overly disappointed about this, for this is just a small leisurely game before the grandness of the festival. Should you fail this time, you can always come again. Besides, not a single game amongst the roaring festivities is one to be missed!",
