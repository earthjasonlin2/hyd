    "Desc": "The wall lamps used in the area around the Opera Epiclese. Though they utilize a glass-and-metal structure similar to those of other street lamps in the cities of Fontaine, the light is both more gentle and concentrated on a smaller area.\\nThe greatest dramas and most intense clashes in Fontaine unfold on the stage of the Opera Epiclese: love and hatred, passion and vengeance. After the curtain falls, theater enthusiasts will often find a quiet, secluded spot to process their thoughts and feelings. For this reason, the Opera Epiclese has considerately adjusted the lights in some areas to be more gentle to aid theatergoers in reliving the drama.",
