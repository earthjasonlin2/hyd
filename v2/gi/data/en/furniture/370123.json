    "Name": "Valley Pergola: Sun and Rain",
    "Desc": "This unique two-story hexagonal pavilion has a similar design to those of Chenyu Vale. The tall cornices are exquisite, elegantly weaving the scenery like fine needlework. When the sun shines, the shadows will be woven into a muslin veil by the high eaves, and when the gentle rains sweep over, the raindrops will be strung into curtains of pearls. Thus, some have praised it, saying: \"Curtains of pearl, veils of shadow, rain or shine, a suitable place to recline.\"",
