    "Desc": "A simple wooden shed. Its main structure is made from Brightwood and Adhigama Wood. Such sheds are usually built with surplus material from large buildings or the usable remnants of torn-down dilapidated houses to save as much cost as possible. The topping fabric is also often a discarded carpet. In most cases, such sheds only serve as temporary storage for commodities and crates awaiting delivery.",
