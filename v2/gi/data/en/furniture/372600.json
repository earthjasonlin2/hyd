    "Desc": "A type of tea tree with green leaves that can be found in Qiaoying Village. The Chenyu Adeptea of the Vale, renowned throughout Teyvat, is largely harvested from this species.\\nIt is said that tea trees have very stringent requirements for their healthy growth. Amurta researchers have tried many times to transplant them to Sumeru, but they have all failed due to lacking suitable water and soil. Fortunately, this is no trouble at all for a Realm Within that can nourish all things.",
