    "Name": "Burgundy Dewtree",
    "Desc": "A strange tree unique to the region around The Chasm. Its lineage brings it quite close to the Sandbearer Tree, and their respective wood qualities are indeed similar, such that most will not treat the two as separate species. However, this tree sports smoky-red leaves of exceeding loveliness as a result of the unique conditions of the land they grow on. It is said that this tree will display the characteristics of the Drooping Dew art of calligraphic penmanship if you look at it from just the right angle, which is how it derives its name.",
