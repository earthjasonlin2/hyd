    "Name": "\"Wings of the Springs\"",
    "Desc": "An inventive medium-sized wooden canopy featuring a distinctive layered roof, named for its resemblance to the overlapping wings of birds. The primary advantage of this design lies in its dynamic light management: it provides effective shade during midday when sunlight is direct, while allowing slanted rays to filter through the spaces between the layers in the morning and evening, keeping the interior warm and comfortable. However, this layered design also adds to the building's overall weight and construction costs, limiting its application within the \"People of the Springs.\"",
