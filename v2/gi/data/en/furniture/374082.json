    "Desc": "A plain and simple wood-carved hat that can be used to assemble an \"Aranara Carving.\"\\nIt was modeled after the hats of Aranara depicted in the oldest Aranara fairy tales. According to those ancient stories, Aranara are only common forest dwellers with no clear division of labor who show up in front of the children one day out of nowhere. These tales may be as old as time but will not be forgotten no matter what.",
