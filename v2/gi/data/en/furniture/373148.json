    "Name": "Heavy Brightwood Pottery Wheel",
    "Desc": "Heavy crafting equipment made from Brightwood. It is somewhat difficult to operate compared to ordinary pottery wheels and requires the close cooperation between two users. However, with larger pottery wheels, one can easily craft pottery pieces the height of a person. The wheel is usually locked with a wooden stick to keep playful children away.",
