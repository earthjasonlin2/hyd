    "Name": "Withered Buttershroom",
    "Desc": "Mushrooms with broad caps that are known to take on their vivid \"buttery\" color under the sunlight. Their unique patterns cause them to resemble withered leaves, hence the name. Though their unique colors are quite similar to that of certain herbs, this type of mushroom lacks any special medicinal properties, and in fact is poisonous to some degree. Do not eat them!",
