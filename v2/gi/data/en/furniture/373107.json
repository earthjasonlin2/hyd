    "Desc": "An open sack in which grains, fruit, and vegetables can be stored. The sack is made of an excellent pest-proof material that is only produced in Qingce Village today.\\nMosquitoes tend to produce a rumbling sound and are hard to track with the naked eye, and thus used to have the moniker of \"Invisible Buzz\" in Liyue.\\nConsidering that mosquitoes are capable to spreading pestilence, countering their influence is indeed very important.",
