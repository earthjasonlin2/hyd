    "Name": "Desert Wall-Drapes: Sunset",
    "Desc": "Wall-drapes the color of red evening clouds.\\nAaru Village is not known for the bounties of nature, but its residents can still make good use of its limited resources: They extract dye from common desert plants and weave the remaining fibers — some of which are thin and sturdy — into various ornaments and tools. Such drapes are some of the finer products that are exchanged for other goods with Caravan Ribat's merchants.\\nResearchers staying in Caravan Ribat noticed the material's endurance and thus incorporated desert plants into their plant fiber research.",
