    "Name": "Common Cooking Device",
    "Desc": "The device whose official name is the Common Cooking Device. It consists of a tightly sealed pot and furnace, which isolates it as much as possible from any outside environmental influences, decreasing the safety hazards posed by an open fire and making it suitable for as many use cases as possible. When this device was first designed, one could have added a pressurization mechanism to the entrance of the pot, which would have allowed one to cook food under high pressure to improve the texture. However, this function was discarded by the engineers during mass production due to material and capital limitations.",
