    "Name": "Hued Vase: Crimson Sands",
    "Desc": "A great clay pot that is taller than a person and that possesses stunning volume. Suitable for storing grains and dry goods, it is often used by Puspa Caf√© to store coffee beans, with the speed at which two such pots' worth of beans sell out being one of the measures for briskness of business. A ladder is required to get to the pot's mouth and retrieve its contents, and one has to be careful while doing that to ensure that one does not fall in. As such, some artisans have added a safety net to the pot's opening.",
