    "Name": "Wushou Dance Doll: Sleepy Suanni",
    "Desc": "This soft yet exquisite Wushou Dance doll vividly reproduces the adorable yet sleepy nature of the animal itself, while adopting the same design as the props and costumes used in Just Wushou Dance!\\nWhen it comes to festivals, people often think of a joyful celebration, of not needing to get up early to go to work, so why not be just like this little Suanni and lie down to enjoy a little breather?",
