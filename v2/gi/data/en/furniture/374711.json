    "Name": "Shop Ornament: A Basket of Scents",
    "Desc": "This ornament, hung in a very visible spot at the storefront, contains a flower basket filled with blue flowers. Its aroma is light and elegant, and when customer flow is the thickest, a resting staff member will find these flowers a most effective balm for their fatigue.\\n\"According to Paimon, the scent from these flowers can make your thoughts clearer!\"\\n\"Now, I'm not sure if it was due to these flowers or not, but I can say that Paimon has been making fewer arithmetic mistakes in her Shopkeeper Log entries lately.\"",
