    "Desc": "A simple clay grill with minimalistic red patterns that can be found in the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. Its simple appearance belies the high skill level needed to operate it. They say that experienced users can prepare all manner of dishes with distinct characteristics using this device. The secret lies in mastering \"distance,\" much like in combat.
