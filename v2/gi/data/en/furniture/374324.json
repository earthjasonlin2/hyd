    "Name": "Mallow Wood Round Table: \"A Shared Drink\"",
    "Desc": "A simple round wooden table with a plain appearance that is so light, even a child can easily carry them.\\nThey say that since very few guests visit Petrichor, most chairs and tables are relatively low, unlike the opulent furniture found in the Court of Fontaine. When invited to a resident's home, should you be invited by the host to sit down for afternoon tea at a table like this, please do not think yourself unwelcome. On the contrary, this is how Petrichor welcomes its true friends.",
