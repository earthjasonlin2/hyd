    "Desc": "A collection of wine vessels from Sumeru that use thin metals with beautiful patterns and images drawn onto them, and the dyes have a faint fruity scent to them. The innards of such containers have a special coating that can prevent metallic smells from seeping into the drinks. It is said that this can impart a \"fresh\" taste upon some special wines.",
