    "Name": "Wooden Torso: Cozy Rest",
    "Desc": "A lovely, seated woodcarving torso that can be used to assemble an \"Aranara Carving.\" It is unpainted and has the unique texture and aroma of logs.\\nNot all children like running and jumping, and so it most likely is with Aranara as well. Some Aranara prefer sitting on the ground, quietly watching their friends as they frolic in the forest.",
