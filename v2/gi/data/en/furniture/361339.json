    "Name": "Countless Services",
    "Desc": "A multipurpose low table made from Ashen Aratiku Wood. Its advantages lie in its simple structure, low cost, and ease of use, and it can be found in the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. The name \"Countless Services\" is indicative of these advantages. Aside from having the functions of an ordinary table, it can also serve as a display rack; and in a pinch, it can even be used as a footstool. Additionally, it is relatively light and can easily be moved off to different locations at low cost, and can be manufactured and used in large quantities. A true paradigm of furniture design.",
