    "Name": "Forest Ranger's Provisions",
    "Desc": "A backpack that's been filled to the brim. A must-have for Forest Rangers going on long missions. Supposedly, apart from commonly used tools, emergency rations, and containers to store specimens, the backpack also contains a tent that can be quickly pitched. If the Ranger finds an appropriate resting spot and doesn't need a tent, it can also serve as a thick carpet. Unfortunately, Forest Rangers seldom take this backpack with them due to the item's extreme weight.",
