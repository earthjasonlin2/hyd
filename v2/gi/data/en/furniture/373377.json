    "Name": "\"Petaled Shade\"",
    "Desc": "Parasols scattered amidst the sea of flowers that seemingly show no trace of any tool-work. The parasol rib structure seems to have been made using unprocessed straight wood, while the parasol face seems to be made from the large leaf of some plant, making this almost seem like a mysterious plant in and of itself. Even though this object possesses no fixed support structures, stabbing it deeply into the earth will render it quite stable nonetheless, thus giving you a little shade to enjoy in the placid flowery sea.",
