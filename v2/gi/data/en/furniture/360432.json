    "Name": "Passage's Appetizing Lamp",
    "Desc": "One of the most popular lamps in the Court of Fontaine. It adopts the classic table lamp design and features a suction cup at the base to firmly hold it in place, preventing it from falling victims to the dangers of table instability or mischievous pets. Its meticulously tinted shade creates a unique visual effect, enhancing the colors of beverages like Fonta, and making them appear more delicious and inviting. Even a cup of coffee will look as though it is covered with a layer of Bulle Fruit frosting.",
