    "Name": "Mansion Courtyard â€” Warbling Pavilion",
    "Desc": "A pavilion from Sumeru Mansion: Meditative Retreat that showcases sights from nature. It appears as a structure formed from the coming-together of several trees. The ceiling made of verdant leaves is quite attractive for birds, while the platform below provides a suitable place for other animals to take shelter. Amidst the demure fragrance wafting through the air, the animals all appear well-behaved and at ease with each other, often conversing with sonorous melodies.",
