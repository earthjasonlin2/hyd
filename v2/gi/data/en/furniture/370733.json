    "Name": "Silky Queller of Sea Monsters",
    "Desc": "This tall and spacious stall is often used for selling all kinds of textiles. It is structurally similar to the most eye-catching store in the market west of Port Ormos. After hearing the owner's story, some foreign sailors decided that her textiles could be used to ward off sea monsters. Though it became a widespread rumor among a certain group of people, the store owner remains unaware of this affair and of the reason for the uptick in business.",
