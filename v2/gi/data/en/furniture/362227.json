    "Name": "Plain Vase: Sepia",
    "Desc": "A sepia pottery piece with a pedestrian appearance. Its shape and production process all follow Sumeru's most ancient firing methods. Such utensils are also known as \"treasure vases,\" implying that whatever is stored inside must be some kind of treasure.\\nIn the very beginning, residents in Sumeru would use a certain type of soil dug from the rainforests as raw materials to create all kinds of pottery. However, due to the insufficient content of certain minerals in such materials and the limitations of their craftsmanship, the lifespan of the pottery pieces produced then was fairly limited. After a few years, they tended to become incredibly brittle and fragile. Some potteries still produce this kind of earthenware and often sell them in bulk as the cheapest containers. The earliest batch of such pieces, however, have become rare collectors' items.",
