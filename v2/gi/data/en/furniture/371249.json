    "Name": "Courtyard Corridor: The Mora Dividend",
    "Desc": "The Illusory Annex's straight corridors serve both as walkways shaded from the sun and rain as well as passageways between buildings. A research group at the Fontaine Research Institute believes that in architecture, courtyards can be likened to the canvas used in paintings. Buildings, sculptures, fountains, and so on â€” each represents different geometric shapes in one's image composition, and linear elements like corridors and pathways play a crucial role in connecting these shapes. Even though individual \"lines\" may appear less frequently on the canvas, they are essential in dividing the space up while shaping the overall aesthetic. These \"lines\" are just as precious as Mora, thus resulting in the term \"The Mora Dividend.\"",
