    "Name": "Teahouse Cushion: Night-Woven",
    "Desc": "The cushions used by Komore Teahouse. These are made using dried and woven straw. The weaving method is exceedingly intricate, but when used, it provides little more comfort than a cushion used in a commoner's home might.\\nKomore Teahouse may have many rules and regulations, but these mostly pertain to basic courtesy and etiquette. It has never been overly picky in selecting materials for use in every little thing, or concerned with shallow displays of opulence.",
