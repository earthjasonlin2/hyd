    "Desc": "This display goes at the front of the shop and features a basket filled with golden flowers with a fragrance that, while strong, perfectly meshes with the aromas of various dishes, granting them a unique flavor.\\nPerhaps the various scents carried on the winds of homecoming can indeed carry more subtle thoughts.\\n\"Some customers were especially touched by our snacks, saying that they tasted very familiar — indeed, just like the ones they used to have at home.\"\\n\"Paimon also could not understand what was happening, for were we not just making food as per normal?\"",
