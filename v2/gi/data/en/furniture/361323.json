    "Desc": "A marvelous dinner table of unknown origin. Its color and patterns are very unique, resembling a round pastry that has been baked to perfection. Its outer layer is crisp while the inner layer is soft yet chewy. And just as a grand feast will have tables filled with all manner of dishes, the mottled colors are just like the many condiments that shall go with the pastry, their deliciousness capable of stoking one's appetite at a mere glance, as if all the flavors in the world were contained in this one table.",
