    "Name": "Hued Vase: Eventide",
    "Desc": "This piece of pottery is a deep brass hue throughout, marked by decorative cyan paint. It is said that this color is like \"the ocean horizon upon which the sinking sunset gleams,\" hence the \"Eventide\" name it has. In truth, most desert dwellers have never seen the scenery depicted by this type of pottery.\\nMade in the rainforest areas, they are more expensive, and are often used to store fine wine. Of course, it works perfectly fine as a beautiful tabletop adornment.",
