    "Name": "Glowstone Parasol",
    "Desc": "A magnificent tabletop ornament that looks vaguely like a mushroom. It is made of a strange material that resembles stone but is not stone. There is a rumor among the outlanders in Ritou that the raw material of this ornament originates from a stone in Chinju Forest. When a thousand-year-old stone is cracked open, the inside of the stone takes on a fluid-like texture, as if it is infiltrated by blue fluorescent light. The truth is, the craftsman merely made a purple coating out of inedible jelly and applied it evenly to the ordinary sculpture.",
