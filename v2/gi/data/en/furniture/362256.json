    "Name": "Mallow Wood \"Enhanced\" Platform Ladder",
    "Desc": "A mobile platform ladder made of Mallow Wood often found in venues such as the Palais Mermonia. The strength of a single adult male is sufficient to push the ladder laterally at slightly slower than walking speed, allowing easy access to objects in high places from various positions. Unlike ordinary ladders, which require the user to climb down before they can be moved and then climb up again after repositioning, it significantly improves the efficiency of placing and removing things.",
