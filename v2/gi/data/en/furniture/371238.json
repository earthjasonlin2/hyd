    "Name": "Desert Wall: Surprise Attack",
    "Desc": "A long wall section like the ones that surround the Aaru Village warehouse. They look quite rough-hewn and lack the refinement that an artisan's hands might lend it, but in truth, they have simply been made using incredibly hard rock that is difficult to process further. There is a passage in this wall through which one person abreast may cross, which aids in the movement of soldiers. It is said that such walls have a secret door somewhere along their length to help defenders launch surprise attacks when the enemy is exhausted, allowing them to charge and overrun enemy encampments.",
