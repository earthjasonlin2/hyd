    "Name": "Metropole Funhouse: Conductor",
    "Desc": "A single-story building often seen in Constellation Metropole. At first glance, it appears that there is nothing out of the ordinary about it, but it is extremely adaptable, being useful in a variety of situations as well as being exceptionally easy to modify and maintain. For this reason, not only can these buildings be used as functional homes or in areas designated for specific functions, but they can also serve in the critical role of connectors, linking and coordinating entire blocks of buildings in a pinch, just like the conductor in a band of buildings.",
