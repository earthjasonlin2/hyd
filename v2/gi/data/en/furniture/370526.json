    "Name": "Metropole Funhouse: Cymbalist",
    "Desc": "A smaller two-story building that can be found in Constellation Metropole whose special design incorporates massive gears embedded within. This gives it the appearance of a musician playing the cymbals, for which it is named. It is said that this design's original purpose was to increase the ability of the house to transmit power, allowing it to fulfill specific requirements. Unfortunately, it happens that this design does have several drawbacks, such as limited living specials and high ambient noise levels. Thus, these buildings are usually unsuited for ordinary residential use.",
