    "Name": "\"Poisson's Seasonal Produce\"",
    "Desc": "These fish stalls can be found in Poisson and are typically used in conjunction with temporary sheds. They display various fresh catches, including some rare fish species. It is said that because nearly everyone in Poisson is a dab hand at fishing and cooking fish, the quality of the goods sold at the local fish market is undoubtedly among the best in all of Fontaine. However, Poisson is not entirely welcoming to strangers. If you want to buy the best fish, you might need to gain the trust of the residents first.",
