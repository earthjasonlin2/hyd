    "Desc": "A shelf made from top-notch Karmaphala Wood that's often found in the restaurants, taverns, and cafes of Sumeru City. If the owner of the establishment were to use these shelves to display their most cherished objects, the dark hues of the wood will contrast well with the vivid colors of the collectibles. Together with the owner, staff, account book, personal notebook, and occasional presents from regulars, this shelf and all the marks on its surface have also stood witness to the entire history of the business.",
