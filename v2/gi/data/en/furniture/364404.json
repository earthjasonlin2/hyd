    "Name": "Brightwood Cornering Stairs",
    "Desc": "Cornering stairs made from Brightwood. Although the panels used have been smoked just like the wall panels, a certain amount of moisture has been carefully preserved by strictly limiting the time duration of the smoking process. The experience of stepping on these stairs is extremely pleasant, and they will never creak after a long period of use.",
