    "Name": "Pear Orchard Stage: Yun-Han Style",
    "Desc": "A wide stage that was built on the Jade Chamber during Lantern Rite. It is also the place where Yun Jin first performed the new edition of \"The Divine Damsel of Devastation.\" The stage features a classic design that has been passed down in the Yun-Han Opera Troupe for many generations. The structure and flooring are made from high-quality Fragrant Cedar Wood with meticulous workmanship, but thanks to the clever design, it is easy to set up and maintain, and can be transferred to other performance venues with less manpower. The circular design facilitates the arrangement of the guest seats, allowing each guest to maintain the best distance from the stage for a wonderful opera-listening experience.\\nIt is said that Yun-Han Opera Troupe built two stages: one for performances and one for practice and rehearsals. Yun Jin spends the majority of her time practicing on this stage, so much so that veteran artists can even find the shoe prints left behind by Yun Jin's tireless efforts at certain spots of the stage.",
