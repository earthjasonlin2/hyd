    "Name": "\"Maison Cardinalice's Winged Shelf\"",
    "Desc": "An irregularly shaped bookshelf that is styled similarly to some of the bookshelves in the Palais Mermonia.\\nIts prototype is supposedly a type of \"Winged-Type Clockwork-Driven Wooden Double-Doored Safe\" designed by Fontaine Research Institute for a certain chamber of commerce. However, due to substandard hinge strength, the finished product merely retained the appearance of unfolding wings. In the end, the Palais Mermonia purchased this somewhat artistic design at a discounted price and has kept it ever since.",
