    "Name": "Replica Ancient Otogi Crate",
    "Desc": "A sturdy Otogi Wood crate that has adopted a design very similar to that of Liyue-style windows. This sort of cargo crate was designed to transport fish, and can effectively prevent the fish from rotting and starting to smell inside a tightly enclosed environment. This design would eventually catch on in the markets and become used to carry all manner of foodstuffs and construction material, even military material.",
