    "Name": "\"Court of Justice's Respect\"",
    "Desc": "A metal and glass building that looks like a fortress. It has the same design as the \"Cabinet D'avocats.\" Compared to other buildings in the Court of Fontaine, this one has thicker walls and a tighter layout that gives visitors a distinct sense of \"solemnity.\" When most city residents pass by, they will speak a little softer, and indeed, will avoid making any noise at all â€” an expression of respect for the traditions of trials, and also for the Champion Duelists.",
