    "Name": "Toy Stand: Dazzling Delights",
    "Desc": "A stand with a variety of interesting toys on display, the most popular of which are the kites.\\nLegend has it that the Millelith once used kites to deliver messages and even used large-scale kites to transport heavier freight items. As a result, kids who were relatively light and still unable to use wind gliders were required to obtain the consent of their parents before flying a kite to avoid any potential mishaps.\\nFurthermore, the Ministry of Civil Affairs has expressly stipulated that flying kites is strictly forbidden in Feiyun Slope and Yujing Terrace.",
