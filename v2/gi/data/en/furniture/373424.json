    "Name": "\"Yet Another Discussion\"",
    "Desc": "A signboard made of sturdy Linden Wood that is a common sight in the Court of Fontaine. They say that this sort of wooden board originates from the discussion boards that opera enthusiasts would put up before the doors of the Opera Epiclese to use as discussion boards. But so impassioned was the discourse, and so many were the participants, that the Maison Gardiennage was forced to spend several months dismantling them all to keep public order.\\nHowever, despite the removal of a vast majority of the boards, this method of communicating through announcement boards continues to persist in the Court of Fontaine. Following the principle of \"establishing a semblance of order no matter what,\" the Palais Mermonia made revisions to city ordinances, regulating the locations and manner in which such boards could appear.\\n...But when they were done, and announced the measures to the public, they found that the phenomenon then significantly decreased throughout the Court. How very strange indeed.",
