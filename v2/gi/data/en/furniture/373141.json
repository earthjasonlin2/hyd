    "Desc": "This device is of the same breed as the Melodic Blooms in the Golden Apple Archipelago, and are copies of the curious plants present in \"The Islands' Stirring Strings.\" Their functions are somewhat different, but they have similar internal structure.\\nConstructs that yearn for lovely melodies, when awakened by lilting dulcet notes, will give their own spirited reply. They are more than willing to generously offer people the extraordinary experience of riding on the winds of music.\\nPlace \"Allegro Bloom: Special Tuning\" to continuously unleash a wind current.",
