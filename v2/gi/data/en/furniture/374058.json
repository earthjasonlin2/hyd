    "Desc": "A sullen woodcarving head that can be used to assemble an \"Aranara Carving.\" It's painted pink and reminds people of huge flowers in full bloom.\\nAccording to a study by a renowned Haravatat researcher, children are more likely to accept stories with protagonists who get kicked in the teeth, probably because most fairy tales have a happy ending, which is not the case in the adults' world.",
