    "Name": "Fontaine Villa: Illusory Annex",
    "Desc": "The Swirling Scene in a Bottle faithfully reproduces a magnificent mansion set against the backdrop of the Fontainian landscape within the Serenitea Pot. It centers around a symmetrical, orderly columnal structure, complemented by trademark Fontainian geometric decorations. The overall design is solemn but not rigid; instead, it exudes an \"agile opulence,\" perfectly capturing the essence of Fontainian architecture. While it may not be as bright as other buildings in the region with their abundant glass domes, it retains the original shades of slag cement on the exterior walls, creating a romantic atmosphere through its simplicity. One's imagination is sure to run wild continuously as one strolls through this mansion's halls.",
