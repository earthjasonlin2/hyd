    "Desc": "A lovely and lush Sakura Tree that has the purest \"cherry color.\"\\nIn daylight, the radiant crowns of these trees catch the sunlight. When the gentle wind blows through, its leaves fall like rain, scattering their light yet rich fragrance all around. Four parts elegance, three parts sweetness, two parts warmth, and one part tranquility, its aroma blend guides people into sweet sleep like pillows of Yumemiru Wood, allowing them to have sweet dreams for so long as they rest under the tree's shade.",
