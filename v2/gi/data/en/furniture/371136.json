    "Desc": "An elegant and artistic fountain, designed in the same style as the Fountain of Lucine in Erinnyes. Such a pleasing visual design makes it one of the most famous tourist attractions in Fontaine. It is said that the Fountain of Lucine, where all water in Fontaine converges, is able to realize wishes and hopes. With such beautiful rumors circulating ever more widely among the people, the tradition of newlyweds coming here to ask for a child became nearly universally known as well.",
