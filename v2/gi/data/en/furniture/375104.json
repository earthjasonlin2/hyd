    "Name": "Sumeru Mansion: Meditative Retreat",
    "Desc": "Nature's True Fruit created this sizable mansion in the Serenitea Pot to reproduce the sights of Sumeru. It is a wooden residence nestled high above thriving ancient trees and vines. Beautiful without opulence and simple without lacking in substance, the style of this building is somewhat similar to that of the dwellings in Gandharva Ville. Though it is somewhat less impressive than the bright and orderly buildings of Sumeru City, staying in this place for a long time will make one feel calm and at ease, as if they were surrounded by a tranquil rainforest. No matter what difficult questions may plague those who reside here, they are sure to quickly find the key inspiration they've been searching for.",
