    "Name": "\"Maison Cardinalice's High Shelf\"",
    "Desc": "A large bookshelf filled with a large number of sequentially arranged books often seen in the Palais Mermonia. The books are arranged as follows: frequently used books are at the bottom for convenient access, while the more complicated and difficult books are on the upper shelves. Generally speaking, only the books at the bottom are required to complete most daily work tasks, but from time to time, problems arise that require consulting the thick and heavy tomes at the top. As time passed, the essential yet rarely used books came to be known as the \"High Shelf Collection\" by the employees of the Palais Mermonia.",
