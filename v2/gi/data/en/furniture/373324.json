    "Name": "Maple Wood White Kitsune",
    "Desc": "These exquisitely crafted white Kitsune dolls also use the process of covering the wooden skeleton with fabric. Compared with the tanuki dolls of the same series, the price of these are slightly higher. This is because the people of Inazuma have a special endearment for Kitsunes, and the white Kitsune dolls are always sold out. Only by raising the price can they be bought in the non-public collectibles market.",
