    "Name": "The Bellflower Bids the Gloom Farewell",
    "Desc": "A lovely sakura tree that is marked by its arresting bellflower-blue coloration.\\nTechnically, these trees are not directly related to the Thunder Sakura, but a certain adventurer once claimed that you could be hit by a \"wondrous bolt\" when standing near this tree, numbing you just enough to help you relieve some mental stress. As such, many artists and writers have sought such sakura trees out to experience their trademark \"shock therapy.\" Truth be told, these sakura trees do not themselves possess the power of lightning â€” one would have the Electro Crystals buried in the wetland soil near these trees to thank for that.",
