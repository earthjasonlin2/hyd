    "Name": "Flowering Shrub: Amidst Harbor Mists",
    "Desc": "A shrub bedecked with fresh misty-blue flowers that is often used as an aesthetic support to other plants around the Fountain of Lucine. It is said that the concept behind these shrubs was a creative work that used flowers as a canvas  â€” \"Amidst Harbor Mists.\" That painting made people realize that flowers need not be the star of the show, but also play the role of the foil. To commemorate this, the gardeners decided to name the very first \"aesthetic foil shrub\" after said artwork.",
