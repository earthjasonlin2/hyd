    "Name": "Simple Brightwood Carved Wall",
    "Desc": "Sumeru-style wall panels with leaf-shaped window shutters, made from Brightwood processed in two different ways. The light-colored panels come from younger trees and have undergone no tempering, while the dark-colored panels have been dried and smoked to resemble the color of ancient timber. Neither had been painted, instead showing natural, harmonized hues.",
