    "Name": "Otogi \"Rakushi\" Square Table",
    "Desc": "A square table made from enjoined Otogi Wood planks. It's a bit rough-hewn, but few people really care about that.\\nThere is a certain game that is played during festivals that goes like this: people sit around a square table and draw slips from a bamboo cylinder similar to the ones used to draw fortune slips. The items drawn have seashells or small amounts of Mora specially printed on them, and this game is said to help you train your luck and draw good fortunes in the future. Of course, it isn't clear if there's any truth to this, so just focus on having fun when you play this game.",
