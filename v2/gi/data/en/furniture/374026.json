    "Name": "Snowman Nose: Lying Carrot",
    "Desc": "A snowman nose made using a carrot. Can be used to build a Puffy Snowman.\\nSome ancient children's tales make mention of a kind of magic that works all over the continent â€” if a child lied too often, their nose would grow as sharp and long as a carrot.\\nSnowmen are considered to be \"honest and pure souls,\" so some clever children press carrots onto them to use as noses to \"offset the magic of the ancient fairy tales.\"",
