    "Name": "Glowing Amusement Park Candy Lamp",
    "Desc": "A common streetlamp seen throughout the Veluriyam Mirage, they are crystal-like luminescent candies hung on the branches. Many guests who came in the past thought that \"If candy did grow on trees, that's definitely what it would look like.\" Over time, the staff themselves accepted this origin story, and passed it on to new guests. It is said that Idyia herself is planning to make candies shaped like the lamps, as a special amusement park dessert. Of course, Idyia and the staff take care to remind visitors, do not touch lit lamps if you don't want to get burned.",
