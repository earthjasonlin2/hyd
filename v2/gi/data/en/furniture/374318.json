    "Name": "Passage's Pristine Round Table",
    "Desc": "A round wooden table commonly found in the Court of Fontaine, these tables are the most diligent \"employees\" in various food establishments. Caf√© Lutece is perhaps the most well-known establishment featuring these round tables. Made from the finest Linden Wood and covered with a uniquely-styled tablecloth which has been coated with a thin layer of wax by clockwork meka. This coat provides a splash-resistant surface that can be easily cleaned with water without leaving visible stains. Legend has it that this waxing process was inspired by the fishers of Poisson. They discovered a long time ago that applying wax to ship sails prevented staining and excessive water absorption during rainy weather.\\nHowever, with the advent of new devices to power ships, fewer Poisson residents are familiar with this process, and fewer still are concerned with the history of a tablecloth's finishing technique.",
