    "Name": "Fabled Emperor Onikabuto",
    "Desc": "A highly life-like onikabuto figurine that has been made with great care. The texture of the materials used is very close to that which makes up an onikabuto's exoskeleton and is highly detailed, this making it look very much like a living onikabuto, easily fooling even lovers of bug fights.\\nCompared to normal onikabuto, Emperor Onikabuto have more attractive patterns and majestic horns. If this sort of onikabuto really does exist, it would probably be utterly invincible in the field of bug battles.",
