    "Name": "Stone Lion Statue: The Knowing",
    "Desc": "A stone lion statue that is used to ward off evil spirits. This stone lion stands guard over the left-hand side.\\nLegend has it that the first stone lions were built from jade and based on the forms of adepti. Their ability to frighten evil away has seen to it that they may be found throughout Liyue.\\nLegend has it that two ancient stone lions dwell at the bed of the Bishui River. A certain fisherman was once attacked by monsters who suddenly fled after espying a cold light glittering on the surface of the water.\\nRunning back to the safety of Wangshu Inn, the fisherman related his experience to the manager, who simply smiled and advised him to prepare a serving of Almond Tofu and place it on a table facing south â€” just as a little token of appreciation for the adepti.",
