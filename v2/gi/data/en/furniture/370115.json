    "Name": "Yumemiru \"Decorum\" Kimono Rack",
    "Desc": "A kimono rack that is displayed in the Yashiro Commission Headquarters. When the Clan Head travels or meets with guests, they will wear the overcoat that sits on this kimono rack.\\nHowever, the current head, Kamisato Ayato, is often busy with various matters and is often out of doors, while it is the Shirasagi Himegimi, Kamisato Ayaka, who often stays at the headquarters. As such, the kimono that currently rests upon that rack is a relatively looser and lighter ceremonial dress that Ayaka uses when practicing calligraphy.",
