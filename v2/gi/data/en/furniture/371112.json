    "Name": "Scarlet Torii Gate: Way of Restoration",
    "Desc": "A torii gate like the ones used at the Grand Narukami Shrine. The path that winds its way up Mt. Yougou is lined with such gates. A significant number of those who come to the shrine to pray believe that it is important to pass through each and every torii gate, for each passage is equal to one blessing. Those who hold to such a belief fear naught even should they obtain an inauspicious fortune slip.",
