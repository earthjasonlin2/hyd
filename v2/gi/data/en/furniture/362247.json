    "Name": "\"Baobab's Golden Cradle\"",
    "Desc": "A curved cat scratch board. Themed with transparent-seeming gold, this is a cat toy specially ordered for Baobab. It is said that this toy was designed with suspension in mind, rocking back and forth like a cradle. As Baobab's body weight rose uncontrollably, however, along with his habit of inviting his friends up to swing alongside him, safety became a major concern. Ultimately, this cat toy was modified and fixed to the ground for stability, thereafter becoming a major incentive for certain cats to lose some weight.",
