    "Desc": "Hilichurl-style archery target boards. The boards themselves are of moderate size and are suited for the sort of strict training that will produce good shooters.\\nIt's just a shame that they're not all too sturdy — in fact, they're liable to fall apart after taking a few arrows. So much for a \"training plan\" as well — in what world would dancing and taking naps be part of archery practice?",
