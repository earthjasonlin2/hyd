    "Name": "Dream of Dandelions and Wolfhooks",
    "Desc": "A strange plant growing in the Veluriyam Mirage, it appears as light as a balloon and to be nearly floating. In the eyes of visitors from Mondstadt, the color is similar to that of a drink that combines dandelions and wolfhook juice, and they have a curious fruity smell. The floating ball-shaped structures at the top are hollow flower blossoms, and are not edible fruits, but they can produce sweet juice. However, in Veluriyam Mirage, they are considered ornamental, and are not to be picked.",
