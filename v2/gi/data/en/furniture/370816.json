    "Name": "Distributed Forward Supply Depot",
    "Desc": "A type of tent scattered throughout the wilderness of Fontaine. Pallets, chests, and barrels are often stored inside without any external markings. It is simply constructed from readily available materials, yet able to withstand the elements.\\nIn general, factions including clockwork meka under the Maison Gardiennage's control, adventurers, or the Treasure Hoarders all tend to construct such cost-efficient tents. The Maison Gardiennage specially sets up such tents along some meka patrol routes and calls them \"Distributed Forward Supply Depots\" to resupply affiliated personnel and agents while out in the countryside so they needn't return to the cities. But sometimes, unknown parties use or steal the provisions within, causing great losses.",
