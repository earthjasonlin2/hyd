    "Name": "Valley Residence: Measured Building",
    "Desc": "A tall residential building commonly found in Chenyu Vale. It uses a special \"mezzanine\" design that allows it to provide considerable usable space while also occupying a relatively small area.\\nThus, this kind of design is often used to expand storage space, fill gaps, or create partitions. There is just such a building next to the Jiulue Teahouse stage in Yilong Wharf. There it simultaneously serves as storage and a resting room, showcasing the advantages it offers in terms of space utilization.",
