    "Desc": "An imposing edifice in the style of \"People of the Springs,\" the building is constructed entirely from fine \"White Chestnut Oak Wood.\" The renowned \"Golden Dusk\" establishment employs this architectural style. It is said that the most striking feature of \"Golden Dusk\" is not its breathtaking scenery or distinctive cuisine, but rather the warm, inviting atmosphere that assures every guest a sense of relaxation. The proprietor's friendly greetings, enthusiastic service, and the melodious performances all create a home-like comfort that epitomizes the \"Secret Menu\" of the establishment.",
