    "Name": "The Bountiful Waterside",
    "Desc": "A plant that grows along the water's edge, often overlooked due to its unremarkable appearance. However, these plants actually have considerable value, for the area they grow in is usually full of minerals specific to wetlands, and thus, they can be made into fish bait. Even though they're not as attractive to the fish as the bait sold by the Fishing Association, they're still a popular product due to their abundance and affordability.",
