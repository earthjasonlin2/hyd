    "Name": "\"No Fishing Ahead\"",
    "Desc": "This simple fence is crafted with Brightwood and vines, and has two triangular patterns on it. It is said that to maintain ecological balance, Forest Watchers once erected these fences around no-fishing zones. But only failing ecosystems require such protection, and those are rather rare in Sumeru nowadays. Therefore, these fences are treated as boundary markers most of the time.",
