    "Name": "\"Boxing Target of the Forbidden Fortress\"",
    "Desc": "A special device that can be found throughout the Fortress of Meropide, used to relieve stress, improve one's physical constitution, and assist in combat practice. They say that this device has its origins in the boundless passion its designer had for combat — the catch being that more people in the Fortress preferred to use it as an outlet for their feelings than as a way of improving their fighting skills. Fortunately, the targets did not seem to take much damage despite being hit so many times. It certainly helped, of course, that their designer had made them exceedingly tough, with the awesome combat strength that they did not presently have but would surely possess in the future. The result of this was boxing targets sturdier than even some clockwork meka, that would be quite difficult to destroy — well, at least before you come to possess awesome combat skills, that is.",
