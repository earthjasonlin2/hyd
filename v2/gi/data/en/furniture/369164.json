    "Name": "Sacred Ibis",
    "Desc": "A noble bird that has broad wings and sleek legs.\\nIt lives near desert oases, and it was once widely worshipped as a symbol of the divine. The ancient legends of the desert migrants say that these beings are the guardians of lost shrines and that they have the sacred power to deflect calamity.\\nEven now, in the Realm Within, this power seems to still be in effect. When other animals are near them, they will not meet with any accidents or get into any kerfuffles. Hence, even the bravest of Masked Weasels will not dare to pluck a single feather from these avians' bodies.",
