    "Name": "Gloomy Glamour",
    "Desc": "A strange, vibrant plant. Its thick trunk and rare blue-violet leaves make it look particularly breathtaking.\\nUnlike many other plants with cold-hued flowers, the unique color of this plant comes from a specific ingredient in the soil, and it is the only known plant species that will react to this substance.\\nDue to this unique characteristic, this plant usually requires meticulous care when grown in horticulture and scores a hefty price as an ornamental species.",
