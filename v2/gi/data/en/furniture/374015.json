    "Desc": "A soft, fluffy red nightcap. Can be used to build a Puffy Snowman.\\n\"You can play with the snowmen tomorrow!\" So the adults tell the children. \"Snowmen need to sleep too, you know? They go off to Dreamland once we head back home!\" These sayings wound up being taken for truth by the children, and some gentle kids give their snowmen comfy sleeping caps as a result.",
