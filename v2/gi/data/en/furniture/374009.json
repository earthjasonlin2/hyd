    "Desc": "Two hands holding a broom. Can be used to build a Puffy Snowman.\\nSnowmen equipped with such hands suddenly appear most proper indeed, gaining a sense of duty not unlike a Knight of Favonius might have while manning their post. As to what this duty might be... Sweeping the leftover snow out of the courtyard, perhaps?\\nAs such, it has also gained the honored, if comically exaggerated, nickname of \"Hands of the Chivalrous Cleaner.\"",
