    "Name": "Dendro Crystalfly",
    "Desc": "Pure elemental life-forms composed of drifting Dendro particles, as free and unbound as the butterflies they resemble.\\nA glittering Dendro creature that is the product of rising and condensing elements, and which feeds off the ubiquitous power of Dendro.\\nTubby says that even in the Realm Within, these Dendro Crystalflies still have a wondrous influence on life â€” after they linger in an area for some time, the plants there will somehow become more robust.
