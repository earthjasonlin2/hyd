    "Name": "Valley Residence: Tender Countryside",
    "Desc": "A small yet exquisite dwelling extremely commonplace in Chenyu Vale, with a traditional pitched roof design. This helps maintain the interior temperature, helping it stay warm in winter and cool in summer, and greatly increasing the comfort of the occupants. The interior utilizes Fragrant Cedar Wood, making it reliable and affordable. The structure is quite adaptable to both the owner's needs and the outside environment, as it is easy to modify and can also be constructed on all sorts of terrain. Thus, most residential buildings in Chenyu Vale utilize this type of framework or one of its derivatives.",
