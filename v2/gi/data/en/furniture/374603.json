    "Name": "Easy Breezy Shelter Canopy",
    "Desc": "A shelter for a waiting area shaped like an umbrella, using a frame of light and reliable Cypress Wood. It can be seen at Maritime Express stations. This kind of waiting area canopy utilizes an openwork design, partially to reduce the overall weight of the canopy, making maintenance easier, but also in light of the seaside location of stations, subjecting them to frequent and sudden assault by winds caused by sea and land temperature differentials. A solid canopy would produce greater wind resistance and would be easily damaged, destroyed, or even blown away by long-term exposure to sea winds. However, such a design also means that the canopy doesn't block the rain, leaving it a bit lacking in terms of practicality.",
