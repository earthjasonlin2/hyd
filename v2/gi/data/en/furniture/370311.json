    "Name": "Woven Depth",
    "Desc": "An exquisite vertical machine. It appears to have only a wooden frame, but there is far more to it. The winding fabric cantilever at the top rotates slowly, releasing the fabric threads as needed as driven by hidden components, weaving fine textures and patterns in such a way that the pattern seems to be slowly \"drawn\" out. This is exactly the machine that the Kshahrewar designed in pursuit of higher productivity, and has become rather popular in Sumeru in less than one hundred years, greatly enriching the fabric market.\\nNevertheless, someone who claims to be a senior researcher but has the appearance of a teenage girl said that they were inspired by some ancient mechanism. This scholar marveled at the mechanism when she first saw it. She said she was going to buy it to bring back for research purposes, but then she heard from others that \"there are mechanisms like these everywhere. What's so special about this one?\" Embarrassed and red in the face, she left immediately.",
