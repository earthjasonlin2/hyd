    "Name": "Spreading Branches of the Sky",
    "Desc": "A tree lush with leaves the color of the sky when the sun is high. When one looks upon it, it will almost feel as if its leaves are becoming one with the skies, and thus have artists named them Spreading Branches of the Sky.\\nHowever, some birds with less than stellar eyesight hold much less love for this tree, for they are wont to mistake its leaves for the sky, thus crashing into its canopy and falling to the earth in disgrace.",
