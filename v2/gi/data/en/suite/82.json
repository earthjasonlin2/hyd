    "Desc": "A square filled with green bushes, vibrant flowers, and a luxurious fountain. The design concept is based on the Fountain of Lucine on Erinnyes.\\nWhen the weather is fine, the fresh mist threads through the flowers on Erinnyes, the sight of which lifts the spirits of both residents and visitors from abroad. Even should one arrive amid a driving shower, the legends that surround the Fountain still fill the heart with wondrous hope.",
