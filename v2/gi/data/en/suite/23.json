    "Name": "Cargo Transfer Station",
    "Desc": "A transit point for moving goods from place to place. Beside the piled-high cargo crates and wooden barrels are drinks for the workers.\\nThough typical porcelain bottles and jugs are quite sturdy these days, they will still break easily under a heavy load. Thus, the workers wish that their foreman would get a cupboard of some sort, rather than leave the bottles on the ground.",
