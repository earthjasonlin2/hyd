    "Desc": "A standard-issue Mondstadt bedroom. The arrangement of furniture takes cues from the Knights of Favonius living quarters.\\nAs the deaconess was praying over the wardrobe to ward off evil, the Knights set an example by turning the foot of their beds to face the wardrobe. Should any ghosts or ghouls appears, they explained, they would promptly leap out of bed and strike first to scare them back whence they came.",
