    "Desc": "During training, new recruits frequently damage their weapons due to improper use. As such, training grounds tend to be stocked with an ample supply of weapons for them to use.\\nFor the Millelith, the weapon wear and tear caused by training is no big deal. Allowing a weapon to come into the hands of the Treasure Hoarders, however, is cause for docking a recruit's salary.",
