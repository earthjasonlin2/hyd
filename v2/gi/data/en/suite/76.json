    "Desc": "A fully decked-out restaurant built in imitation of the Hotel Debord. It is suited to staging lively family banquets to which large numbers of relatives and friends will be invited.\\nEven seasoned chefs cannot deny that the gastronomical mise en scene dictates the feelings of the diners, which influences their overall rating of the food. As such, a beautiful restaurant can also be considered a sort of outer garment for good food and drink.",
