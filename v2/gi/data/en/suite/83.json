    "Desc": "A landscape centered around various unique buildings that recreate a corner of Poisson. Structures that emphasize practicality elevate the work efficiency of those who dwell in them, though this does not immediately translate to busywork and exhaustion, but rather is a way of safeguarding one's leisurely days. Many residents of Poisson, indeed, live by the adage \"Let us be done with work swiftly, so that we may enjoy our rest,\" living full yet simple lives.",
