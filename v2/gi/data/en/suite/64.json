    "Desc": "A bedroom fashioned in the style of those found in Sumeru. The various implements and utensils in here can be found in many houses throughout the city. Thanks to the perfect replication powers of Sub-Space Creation, each furnishing appears as if they were freshly made, giving off a clean, neat, open, and generous feel to any who enter â€” a fine place for rest and repose, if you might say so yourself.\\nEven those who need not worry about food or clothing will sometimes be affected by negativity, and even those in positions most others might envy cannot escape the troubles of life. At such times, emptying one's mind and getting some good sleep, such that one might face the world again at full strength, is the safe and stable choice.",
