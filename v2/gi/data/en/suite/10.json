    "Desc": "A Liyue-style study chock-full of books. There is much to be gained by spending a few hours here.\\nAllegedly, most studies these days are styled after the one at the Feiyun Commerce Guild manor. The Guild's second son made a series of improvements to that study, turning it into a much more efficient environment for reading and writing.",
