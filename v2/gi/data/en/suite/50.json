    "Name": "Rural Concealment",
    "Desc": "This Inazuman village quite effectively recalls the scenery of Konda Village. These buildings are already of a certain \"age,\" but they are far from dilapidated. Instead, they give off a feeling of simple leisure. None of the buildings stand out in particular, and it even seems like they might all blend in with the nearby mountains in a few more years... These are, of course, all the hallmarks of an excellent hiding spot â€” and you can be sure that a certain lazy Shuumatsuban ninja has done just that before, slacking off and sleeping somewhere in an equally sleepy village.",
