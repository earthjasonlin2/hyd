    "Desc": "Many varieties of plants grow in fecundity in this marvelous space, seemingly by the grace of Sub-Space Creation in harmonizing the various specialties that these plants possess such that even ones that come from the desert and the forest can coexist side by side, thus orchestrating a beautiful chorus of flower, tree, and wild grass.\\nFor researchers who love plants, such areas are veritable treasure troves for research, though these vibrant woods will also prove sites of unique interest to ordinary passers-by.",
