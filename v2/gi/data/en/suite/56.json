    "Name": "Eternal Domain of Fleeting Dreams",
    "Desc": "This bedroom is filled with a unique Inazuman aesthetic but also adopts ideas from other nations quite freely, thus striking a brilliant balance between tradition and practicality. The design process included considerations as to how guests might feel, and the room itself was designed for them to relax sufficiently, such that they will feel re-energized, as one might after a long, dreaming sleep, even after only taking a short rest. The kotatsu that has been kindly set up also contributes to the feeling of never wanting to leave your room.",
