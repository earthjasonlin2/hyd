    "Name": "Forest Patrol Anecdotes",
    "Desc": "A fully decked-out break room that takes design cues from the dwellings of the Forest Rangers in Gandharva Ville. The layout of the room has also been tuned to the missions that the Rangers carry out.\\nWhenever the call goes out, they can immediately grab their bags and go, and when they return from patrol, they can also quickly get down to processing, storing, or analyzing samples. If they are on guard until late in the night, they can even use the stove inside to make some supper and restore some energy. All things considered, this break room will allow the Forest Rangers to maintain peak performance at all times... As long as the rosters have been done well, of course.",
