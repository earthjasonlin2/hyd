    "Name": "Amidst Prospering Markets",
    "Desc": "An exquisitely-furnished mercantile district that pays homage to the layout of Sumeru City's streets and its Grand Bazaar. Fresh fruits, delectable dishes, and all manner of lifestyle goods may be found at the stalls here. A few rounds around the area, and you will find a unique ambience one feels when stepping foot into a bustling market.\\nThey say that the shops and stalls on either side of Sumeru's streets have been modified according to specific rules that are the product of some Akademiya research, such that they can provide holistic service with the minimum possible management difficulty and acreage used.",
