    "Desc": "A tranquil settlement that takes on the unique aesthetic of Vimara Village. Even if this furnishing set is not situated by a river or at the seaside, a whiff of the aroma of fish that wafts through this village will set the sound of water gurgling through your ears.\\nVimara Village has a very different feeling from the Forest Ranger camp, for its inhabitants largely do not shoulder important duties and thus lead leisurely lives, thus making it a very nice place to be for those who wish to relax.",
