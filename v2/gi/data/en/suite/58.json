    "Desc": "A healthy collection of texts has been placed here using the large bookcase preferred by all arms of the Tri-Commission. This could fit at least a hundred books for sure. But to some Inazumans, it is not the number of books that counts, but instead \"precision\" and \"precipitation\" â€” that is to say that you must deposit every word of each good book you read into your heart. As such, one merely needs to arrange one's books according to how much one values them. For books that you have long ago read and committed to memory, you can lend them or even sell them if you like. They say that the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island has this exact habit.",
