    "Name": "Court of the Upright",
    "Desc": "This majestic structure combines the Tri-Commission buildings and the Police Station to great effect, it has both the aura of a stately mansion and the practiced professional air of an executive agency, all while maintaining an optimized aesthetic. \"Proper\" is the operative word here indeed.\\nThose of distinguished background and honest character will surely approve of this courtyard layout. Indeed, you have heard it said that a certain Tenryou Commission general once recommended that officials should stay close to the commission estates such that they might get to work more quickly and contribute more effectively to the Almighty Shogun's dream of achieving \"eternity.\"",
