    "Desc": "A study stacked with tomes, its bookcases towering like insurmountable walls. When most people gaze upon the many books laid before their eyes, it might be hard not to feel a little overawed.\\nOf course, those in the know are aware that the boundary between wisdom and ignorance is not some boundary that may not be crossed. So long as one is willing to settle in and read these books, one at a time, following a carefully laid out plan, one will gain an incalculable amount of new knowledge before long.",
