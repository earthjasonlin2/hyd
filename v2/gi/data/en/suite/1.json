    "Desc": "A campsite hastily made by adventurers deep in the wilds.\\nWhen adventurers make camp, they must be sure to place a fence down to fend wild beasts off. But since the area rarely has enough wood to create a complete protection, they must often keep watch on shifts and sound the alarm to avoid any slip-ups and mishaps.",
