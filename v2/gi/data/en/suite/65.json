    "Name": "Dwelling Amidst the Sands",
    "Desc": "An unadorned room that uses implements and utensils that hail from interior designs common to Aaru Village. Those who live amidst the desert winds have many habits suited to life in their unique environment, such as shaking off the sand that might have been brought in along with their clothes in a timely manner, or maintaining the temperature and moisture of a room at little cost...\\nOf course, such practices are not very necessary in the comfy confines of the Realm Within, but they can still cheer and warm the heart, and are thus worthy of respect. This interior setup pays attention to many a small detail such that living in it feels just like living in a desert home.",
