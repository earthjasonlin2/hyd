    "Desc": "This is a place where true swordsmanship is forged. Many hereditary clan swords are arranged here, and a solemn, upright-seated armor sets the austere atmosphere. The Evil-Slaying Bows and Spiritchaser Screen that serve as ornaments have the ceremonial purpose of purging both the surroundings and the hearts of those training there of any wicked thought.\\nMost Inazuman martial artists believe that aside from swinging your sword a thousand times, you only need to maintain the will to sharpen your skills and put your utmost effort into it, and you will surely push yourself to the pinnacle of your art.",
