    "Name": "Of Maple and Tea Scents Entwined",
    "Desc": "The layout of this traditional Inazuman teahouse has used Komore Teahouse as reference material and has used similar Maple Wood tables and tea ceremony items, all of which evoke that elegant but not overly strict, friendly but not arbitrary atmosphere.\\nLegend has it that various forms of inspiration spring forth unto those who sit in a tea room filled with the fragrance of maple wood and tea. As such, some poets tend to write their poetry while sipping tea, with the young wanderer who gave many plants their elegant nicknames counting amongst this number.",
