    "Desc": "An interior with a middle-sized stage as its centerpiece, large enough to stage a small performance.\\nFor those new to performing, an audience too large will cause them undue nerves and affect their performance, and for seasoned masters, sometimes a show put on for one's friends brings one far more happiness than a sold-out extravaganza. As such, most performers can appreciate the lack of grandeur in this stage.",
