                "Text": "Greater Lord Rukkhadevata created Sumeru's rainforest and bestowed wisdom upon the people of Sumeru through the Akademiya. Despite her departure long ago, her name is still praised in the stories told in every household in Sumeru.\\nOn the other hand, Lesser Lord Kusanali, who was whisked back by the sages to the Sanctuary of Surasthana following the former's fall, has been more of a symbol — one that signifies that the protection of divinity never ceased to exist on this land.\\nBut the answers to who she is, how she descended, and what powers she has, are rarely known.\\nFrom the highest sage's vague response and evasive attitude toward people's inquiry about Lesser Lord Kusanali, the people in Sumeru deduced that they should no longer expect merciful wisdom to descend from on high as before.\\nThe Akasha, the sublime legacy left by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, is just as handy and helpful as it has always been. What people are not aware of is that the Akasha today has become the ears and eyes of the newborn deity.\\nThrough the Akasha, she has observed every bit of human emotions and attitudes. She is aware of their devotion to the old goddess, their disillusionment with their new deity, and the many comments that \"The God of Wisdom will never come back.\"\\nShe knows in her heart that she must keep learning and grow up as quickly as she can to stand up and face the threats from the most abysmal corners of the world. This is her inevitable duty.\\nThus, whether she is misunderstood or underappreciated, Nahida makes no argument against it.",

She could even compose what she learned into fascinating dreams that are logical, yet beyond imagination.\\nSuch dreams are, in essence, the same as Nahida's marvelous metaphors — they all lead to a dawning understanding of the similarities between two otherwise unrelated things.\\nBut there are times when she meditates on things yet struggles to figure them out, and such incidents usually concern events related to people or society.\\nFor example, when honesty and truth could exempt a person from punishment, some people might turn silent and deceitful; and when with their beloved ones, some people would hurt others with brutal words.\\nIt feels as if the contradictions of the entire world are focused through and manifested by human beings, whose fickle emotions are perplexing to Nahida.\\nIn such moments, her metaphors would not work. Nor could she find any system in this world as a reference for such chaos.\\nShe could only explain it by the fact that the difference between every person's uniqueness creates diverse reactions when they undergo similar emotions.\\nBut this was not a satisfactory answer to Nahida. To better know human beings, plain knowledge and dogma alone would never suffice.\\nPerhaps it was from that moment on that Nahida came to understand why \"she\" had to stand firmly by human beings' side and even made tremendous sacrifices for their sake.\\nFor each and every one of \"them\" is a unique existence in this world.",

As she learns more knowledge, her dreams become even more intricate and full of life.\\nThe dreams not only relax her mind, but also give her chances to examine her new knowledge to see if it goes against common sense or if she is missing any details.\\nWhen Dusk Birds first appeared in Nahida's dream, those birds soared through the sky in a standing posture with their wings folded.\\nIt looked abnormal and caught Nahida's attention immediately. Nahida thus learned how wings worked, after which the Dusk Birds could fly freely in her dreams.\\nNext, she adopted similar methods to fix Shroomboars that slept underwater, Radishes that grew on apple trees, and crystalflies with mismatched wing colors.\\nKnowledge shall not be a mere approach to justify things in this world, it could also be used to satisfy her need for pure innocent fun.\\nTechnically, Shroomboars can only walk on the ground. Now that she understood how wings work, wouldn't Shroomboars with wings fly all the same?\\nAnd where there are flying Shroomboars, it is only natural to have crocodiles that walk on their hind legs and Harra Fruits who speak human languages...\\nThe way Nahida develops her knowledge system has subsequently created a little amusement park for her, free of disturbance. In her dreams, she is in the embrace of boundless happiness.",

Later one day, Nahida borrowed Katheryne's body and took a walk on the streets in the city.
