Some hope to commission her to forge them weapons, while others only seek to see the visage of this great smith, such that they might have information of great interest to talk about.\\nBut Xilonen couldn't care less about what all her customers are thinking. No matter what kind of ridiculous, fancy titles others give her, before all the honors and accolades, she is first and foremost an artisan. All she need do is refine the ore, and surely and steadfastly hammer it into its final shape one blow at a time, in accordance with the customer's requirements. Reputation will not strengthen the blows of her hammer upon the anvil, nor will slander cool the coals of her furnace.\\nHowever, when a customer steps into her workshop, it is not the heat of the furnace that welcomes them, but rather a long form filled with blanks needing to be filled in.\\n\"I'm happy to take the commission. But first, we need to iron out the details.\"\\n\"Effective communication means efficient work. Come on, let's talk about just what you want.\"",

Is that how Name Engravers gain their power!?\"\\nWhen a gaggle of curious young Children of Echoes finally managed to track down Xilonen, the current Name Engraver, who'd hidden herself away in the treetops for an afternoon nap, she yawned and replied in a tone of resignation:\\n\"First of all, forging Ancient Names is a matter of technique.\"\\n\"Huh? But...\"\\n\"Meaning that the key is to study hard, then put what you've learned into practice.\"\\nBut before she could even finish imparting her words of wisdom, the children had already scampered off, wearing dissatisfied pouts. Their wild yet simple imaginings had been disappointed, dropping to the ground like a balloon weighed down by a basket of obsidian. Until another such idea occurred to them, reviving their fantasies and carrying them off into the clouds, they would continue to learn — whether willingly or not.\\n\"Heh, it's not like I was lying...\"\\nThe Name Engraver lay back down, shaded from the sunlight by a canopy of lush vegetation. This was the perfect place for a nap, and the next half an hour or so would be more than enough for her to recharge, ready to tackle the heavy tasks that awaited her.\\n\"The only way anyone can ever hope to make those stories come true is by studying their tail off first...\"",

One by one, they would lean forward onto their desks and drift off to dreamland.\\nEventually, Xilonen would be the only student still awake. Under her tutor's approving gaze, she would even raise the notebook she was holding and ask questions of her own.\\n\"Do Phlogiston Engravings rely on phlogiston flow to operate? If I were to dive into a pool of pure phlogiston, would the engraving diagrams on my body activate, shut down, or blow up?\"\\n\"Does phlogiston exist in a gaseous state? If so, then imagine I were to fill a chimney with it and drop a piece of meat from the top — how tall would the chimney have to be, and how dense the phlogiston, for the meat to be fully cooked at the exact time it reached the bottom?\"\\n\"If losing about 20% of their body fluids can have life-threatening consequences for humans, then how much phlogiston would a Candlecap Mushroom need to lose before it withered or lost its heat?\"\\nThough these questions may strike some as incisive, even slightly peculiar, they did not annoy Teyiz, the renowned Name Engraver, who did not think in the slightest that Xilonen was asking them to cause trouble.\\nThe highly respected Teyiz was simply amazed that Xilonen had the patience to endure such tedious classes.\\nMost children had no interest in such things, preferring classes where the elders told them legends about the heroes of the various tribes. They would imagine themselves as those heroes, skipping right past all the hardship and pain, going straight for fame and glory.\\nXilonen, on the other hand, had no interest in these stories. Yet to ensure that she passed her exams on such subjects, she would \"bribe\" her classmates with milk candies, getting them to lend her their notes. She would proceed to copy it all down, then force herself to memorize everything, just to get a score that would not raise eyebrows.\\nHer strength and her passion lay not in empty fantasies, but rather in precise axioms and equations. As far as she saw it, these were the only things that would benefit future generations; these were the things that were worth studying.\\nAs for those stories... Well, they were neither accurate nor concise, lacked both definitions and axioms, and were simply too chaotic to follow. They held no value for her beyond the points they were worth on the exam papers.\\nDespite seeing all of this, Teyiz chose not to immediately stop Xilonen, nor did she tell her off.\\nBut when the next class was about to begin, and Xilonen got ready to roll out one of her usual excuses — like having a stomachache, or feeling dizzy, or catching a cold — Teyiz cut right through them, one and all.\\n\"I once thought the same way as you do, Xilonen.\"\\nThus did the kindly Name Engraver address her student, patting the notebook of equations that she held.\\n\"But remember — for us Name Engravers, stories and equations are, in essence, one and the same.\"",

Though they had read similar stories in books before, the way Teyiz told them was much more detailed, and far more vivid.\\nThere was one hero who pulled down a stalactite, using it as a spear to pierce a monster's eye; and another who crossed a deep ravine with naught but a single length of rope in solo pursuit of a wicked dragon...\\nLayer upon layer of exciting detail brought these heroes to life, making them flesh and blood in the children's minds.\\nBut an abundance of detail creates greater possibilities for contradiction.\\nThe first child to look up and challenge the storyteller was a little boy who had read many books and had many questions.\\n\"Excuse me, Ma'am, I have a question. In the records I've read, this hero went hunting in the company of his companions. But in your story, he's alone. Why is that?\"\\nTeyiz responded gently:\\n\"I've read that version too. So, which one do you think is closer to the truth?\"\\nBlinking, the child replied:\\n\"I... Uhh... Well, that's what I read...\"\\nThe elderly Name Engraver laughed, then patiently rejoined:\\n\"Then you are questioning the truth on the basis of a single opinion, and have neither proof nor evidence.\"\\nThe child, still refusing to concede defeat, puffed out his chest and replied:\\n\"Stories... How can there be evidence for stories? There are so many out there in the world, it would be impossible to prove them all.\"\\nAfter all, most stories and legends are passed down from mouth to mouth, so over time it is inevitable that they will change and evolve. Even the same tale, the same hero, might end up being portrayed in entirely different ways by the storytellers of different tribes.\\nXilonen, who had been listening for quite some time now, closed her eyes in boredom and began working out a new set of formulas in her head. The idea that there was no order to be found just about summed up her view on the subject too, and as such, she concluded that it was unworthy of further attention.\\nTo their surprise, Teyiz nodded to show her approval of the child's answer, and then said:\\n\"You speak the truth. Natlan is an ocean of heroic legends, and perhaps there really is no way to verify such stories.\"\\n\"Through generations of oral tradition, countless stories have been twisted or exaggerated, focusing on one person's great achievements, while secretly diminishing another's...\"\\n\"But one day, it will be you that holds the forge hammer, and you will be the one tasked with forging the heroic deeds of those who have gone before into Ancient Names.\"\\n\"When that day comes, if the heroic deeds you are to engrave are likewise the subject matter of countless unverified tales, and the focus of unstemmed controversy and debate...\"\\n\"How then will you strike the hammer? How then will you know which version to settle on?\"\\nDespite having been laughing just moments before, the sudden weight of this responsibility made the children fall silent.\\n\"Legends have their patterns, and stories, too, their truths.\"\\n\"You have heard many stories, just as you have read many scrolls.\"\\n\"Now, it's time for your next class.\"\\nVery slightly, Xilonen opened her eyes.\\nIf stories were to be approached from such an angle, she thought, perhaps there might be more in them than she'd given them credit for.",

They combed through every detail, hoping to find connections that could link these stories to other records, trying to add a rough but traceable chain of evidence to prove their credibility.\\nThe children, who once found those very same tales to be a source of endless excitement and entertainment, now found themselves thinking of ways to avoid the class.\\n\"If we keep studying like this, I won't want to read another story... ever again!\"\\n\"I know, right? Everything has to be so... down-to-earth! It's so boring when there's no room for the imagination!\"\\n\"How come you're so into this, Xilonen? Weren't you the one who used to hate reading stories the most?\"\\nXilonen's classmates looked at her quizzically, watching as the pile of notes in front of their clever friend grew ever higher. It was like she had become a different person.\\n\"It's not that I don't like reading stories. I just don't like reading stories that aren't backed up by proof or without any basis in fact.\"\\nXilonen replied with an air of nonchalance, lazily propping up her chin in the palm of her hand.\\nImagination is a bit like the breeze that blows through the cliffs — light, cool, and all around. Yet no one can pin down the shape of the wind, nor can they force it to stay by their side.\\nBut if there was a way to bring the wind down and turn it into something dark, hard, and silent as stone; a way to forge formless stories into something tangible... For Xilonen, a thought experiment like that held some appeal indeed.\\nBut in her heart of hearts, Xilonen did not want to become a Name Engraver. She had no interest in capturing fleeting breezes, nor could she summon up the motivation to haul heavy stones around.\\n\"I don't want to forge Ancient Names. There are so many people in the tribe — why don't you just find someone else to do it?\"\\nXilonen had often observed her father at work. He always wore a big smile on his face whenever he talked business with others, but when the time came to start swinging his hammer, his face would naturally settle into a grim expression. Work always seemed to drain people of their energy, leaving them exhausted both mentally and physically.\\n\"Dad, why did you become a Name Engraver? You must have had a pretty important reason.\"\\n\"Not really, nothing particularly important. I just thought that people who listened to stories... They have a responsibility to pass them down to others too.\" Her father replied as he put down his hammer, wiping the sweat from his brow.\\n\"But aren't there much simpler ways to do that? You could just write down the stories on a scroll, or carve them into stone.\"\\n\"True. Just passing on stories is simple enough.\"\\nHer mother took out a comb, getting ready to give Xilonen a new hairstyle.\\n\"But not everyone is willing to pass on true stories.\"\\n\"Then what about Ms. Teyiz?\"\\n\"She... is one of the few who are willing to do so.\"",

For her tribe, the passing of this Name Engraver did not come as a surprise.\\nShe had grown old, and often told those looking after her that she could hear the whispers of the Wayob in her dreams.\\nBut she said that she couldn't leave just yet, as there were still things she needed to pass on — once she had found the right person, of course. She could not answer the Wayob's call until that time had come.\\n\"...With the blood of this land.\"\\n\"Burn away all impurities, and souls gather in the fire.\"\\nAnd with that, Xilonen let go of the torch, and the pyre began to roar.\\nShe stayed there the entire night. The next morning, she gathered her teacher's ashes into an urn and placed them in the cave she had always spoken of.\\nYet in the world outside, Teyiz's story scattered like a wild wind blowing through the valley.\\nOne person, for instance, claimed that he had been initiated into the true craft of forging Ancient Names by Teyiz herself, producing a signed book from her as proof. Another said that she had left them her workshop, showing the key as evidence. But Xilonen did not concern herself with such petty bickering, such maneuvering for personal gain. What troubled her more deeply were the more insidious lies.\\n\"Apparently, when Teyiz taught the stories of our heroes, she would sometimes question their grounding in truth...\"\\n\"So you heard that too? Good grief... It all sounds quite academic, but what about the children? Surely there's a risk of them being led astray?\"\\n\"Exactly what I was thinking! And I also heard that when she was young, Teyiz concerned herself with nothing other than technical research. Should someone like that really have been teaching our young ones the right way to go about forging Ancient Names? Hmm...\"\\nThrough word of mouth, Teyiz's story was twisted beyond all recognition — one moment held up as a paragon of virtue and selflessness, the next as a pernicious schemer driven purely by ulterior motives. In one version, she was the hero; in the next, a petty villain.\\nWhen people fail to grasp the wind, they instead begin to create for themselves a variety of boxes, then claimed that the wind was whatever shape they'd made.\\nBut the true story will only ever be — can only ever be — that dark, heavy stone.\\nThe next day, the tribespeople were shocked to see that Xilonen, usually so laid-back, seemed like a changed person. As if driven by an endless store of energy, she traveled all over the Children of Echoes' lands, interviewing everyone and anyone connected to Teyiz, reviewing every document she could find that mentioned her old teacher's name. Yet that wasn't enough for Xilonen. She left the tribe, consulting couriers from the Scions of the Canopy, meeting musicians from the People of the Springs, requesting access to the woven scrolls of the Masters of the Night-Wind, scaling the cliffs of the Flower-Feather Clan, stepping through the gates of the Collective of Plenty... With the utmost rigor and painstaking care, Xilonen meticulously recorded every single trace that Teyiz had left out there in the world.\\nNot only were these documents what she needed to refute the slanderous stories and malicious rumors about Teyiz — they were enough to dismiss the strange titles that some had bestowed upon her too.\\nWhat Xilonen wanted to leave behind was a true, unblemished version of Teyiz.\\nOnly flawless ores of the utmost strength could be refined, forged, and eventually tempered into something worthy of being handed down to posterity.\\n...\\n\"Xilonen, why did you set out to become a Name Engraver in the first place? It all looks so tiring...\"\\nXilonen's hammer blows rang out loud as her apprentices watched her, resting their chins in the palms of their hands.\\nXilonen paused for a moment to wipe away the sweat from her brow.\\n\"I never really did. But my father, my mother, my teacher... They all did before me. So what choice did I have?\"\\n\"And besides...\"\\nShe raised her hammer once more.\\n\"Someone has to shoulder the responsibility of telling stories, right?\"",

Things like compressed phlogiston sprayers that let you create Phlogiston Engravings at range, phlogiston-fueled wings that allow for vertical takeoff and landing, even super-size sniper rifles, custom-made for a certain someone...\\nYet among her many inventions, the one that the Children of Echoes have come to know best is without a doubt her specially modified \"Dance-Off Stage.\"\\nAt that time, the latest Drillbit Dance daily dance-off had just kicked off. Dancers took the stage one after another, the searing intensity of their moves and beats as hot as molten lava, driving both the audience and the performers themselves into a state of great excitement.\\nBut just as the contest reached its climax, the old Dance-Off Stage suddenly went haywire. The rhythm and sound became a total mess, making sharp, piercing noises that almost caused a dancer, who was just getting ready to attempt a particularly tricky move, to fall flat on their face. Below, the audience had their hands firmly clamped over their ears.\\nJust as the stage technician began to scratch their head, at a complete loss for how to claw back this embarrassing situation, the music suddenly stabilized. The Dance-Off Stage was back in action; and hearing a languid voice say \"Testing, testing, one, two, three...\" the crowd's attention turned to Xilonen, who they saw holding a bundle of wires in one hand and propping up her chin in the other.\\n\"Testing, testing... Can everyone hear me?\"\\nAlmost instinctively, the dancers nodded back.\\n\"Good. Well, in that case, let's get started.\" Dropping the wires on the ground, Xilonen gave the blinking technician a pat as she sauntered past.\\n\"Let me handle the next track for you too.\"\\n\"Xilonen, you... y—you can DJ!?\"\\n\"Just listen.\"\\nNo sooner had she finished speaking than a new melody, more powerful than any that had come before, began booming out from the stage. After a moment of stunned silence, the audience erupted, cheering even more enthusiastically than before.\\nWhen the Drillbit Dance daily dance-off came to a close, the organizer paid Xilonen an official visit, hoping to convince her to accept the dual role of equipment consultant and special DJ of the Drillbit Dance contest, throwing in a more-than-generous compensation package to sweeten the deal.\\nBut Xilonen declined both titles and compensation, agreeing only to modify the Dance-Off Stage and any related equipment during her free time.\\nAs the conversation ended, the organizer scratched their head and asked:\\n\"Xilonen, none of us had any idea you were such a good DJ... Where did you learn to do that?\"\\n\"I picked up a few things when I went over to the People of the Springs to learn about record pressing, but I've been so busy that I've never had a chance to try them out. Want me to teach you a trick or two?\"\\n\"No, no, no, it'll all just go in one ear and out the other...\" came the organizer's reply, batting off the idea with a vigorous wave of the hands. \"But seriously, don't you want anything in return? This is such a big ask, and besides, you're always so busy to start with.\"\\n\"Well... I do have one request — if you'll consider it.\"\\n\"Please, ask away!\"\\n\"Once I don't have to forge Ancient Names anymore, let me come work for you as an official DJ. How about that?\"",

Just a few days before, she had followed a mining team from the tribe into the mountains to find ore of the very finest quality. She had also asked her dad to modify the furnace so it could hold even more phlogiston, igniting a fiercer and hotter flame that would be intense enough to melt any ore. She had specially re-engraved all of the phlogiston engraving diagrams in the workshop, ensuring that every spark that flew during the forging process was under her complete control.\\nAlright, Xilonen, everything's ready. Strike while the phlogiston's hot, huh? So... Where should the first strike fall? What pattern should I forge? How many strikes will it take?\\nSilence filled the workshop, and even the flames dared not crackle, lest they disturb the craftswoman at work.\\nPlacing her hammer aside, Xilonen picked up a comb fashioned from the tooth of a wild beast in its stead. This comb had been polished sleek and smooth, investing the intense fire that reflected off its surface with a mild, gentler warmth.\\nIts previous owner was a kindly old woman. Whenever Xilonen used to slack off, she would offer to comb her hair as a way of coaxing her back to study.\\nThe old woman would also braid her hair into beautiful, intricate plaits — so complex, in fact, that even Xilonen's mother could not work out how to recreate them, and eventually had to ask for her help. After all, above all others, those were the plaits that Xilonen loved.\\nThe story of Teyiz the Name Engraver resurfaced in Xilonen's mind. That was a story she had hunted down and gathered herself; and now, she would be the one to forge it into a Name.\\nA hammer blow shattered the silence. Each strike was precise and powerful, and no detail of the story was left untold. Even the most fleeting nuances now rose up before her, ready to be wrought by her hammer.\\nAs the final drops of phlogiston were consumed and the furnace began to fade, before her she beheld a brand-new Ancient Name.\\nTeyiz's story had been imprinted into this Name, never to be distorted again.\\nAs for whom the Wayob would bestow it upon... Well, that was the Wayob's concern, not hers.\\nXilonen stood up, dusted off her clothes, and began to tidy up her workshop. She bent down to toss away a few unused pieces of ore into a basket — they were all of excellent quality, and could certainly be re-used for something else.\\n\"Hmm, wonder what I should eat later? Didn't Mom say we'd be having fish for dinner...?\"\\nOne, two, three... the lumps of ore clinked as they landed in her basket.\\nAbsorbed entirely by her dinner plans, Xilonen didn't notice that there was something quite special about the fourth, amber-colored \"ore\" in her hand.\\nWith another soft clink, the Vision landed in her basket too, which Xilonen then carried out of the workshop and casually left outside.\\nHumming a song, Xilonen went off to eat her dinner. It was only during her next forging session that she would finally notice this special \"ore\" of hers.\\nIt was a gift; but also, a responsibility.",

Xilonen switches to high-speed combat blading gear and rushes forward a certain distance before dealing Nightsoul-aligned <color=#FFE699FF>Geo DMG</color> based on her DEF.\\nAfter using this, Xilonen will gain 45 Nightsoul points and enter the Nightsoul's Blessing state. In this state, she will shift to the Blade Roller mode.\\n\\n<color=#FFD780FF>Source Samples</color>\\nXilonen has 3 Samplers with her that can generate different Soundscapes based on her other party members' Elemental Types, decreasing nearby opponents' corresponding Elemental RES while active.\\nThe initial recorded Source Sample within each Sampler will be <color=#FFE699FF>Geo</color>, and for each party member who is <color=#FF9999FF>Pyro</color>/<color=#80C0FFFF>Hydro</color>/<color=#99FFFFFF>Cryo</color>/<color=#FFACFFFF>Electro</color>, 1 <color=#FFE699FF>Geo</color> Sample will change to that corresponding Element.\\nWhile Xilonen is in the Nightsoul's Blessing state, the <color=#FFE699FF>Geo</color> Source Sample she carries will always be active. After unlocking her Passive Talent, \"Netotiliztli's Echoes,\" Xilonen can trigger said Passive Talent's effects to regenerate Nightsoul points for herself. When her Nightsoul points hit the maximum, she will consume all her Nightsoul points and activate the 3 Source Samples she has on hand for 15s.\\nWhen the Source Samples are active, nearby opponents' corresponding Elemental RES will decrease. Source Sample effects of the same Elemental Type cannot stack. Xilonen can trigger these effects even when off-field.\\n\\n<color=#FFD780FF>Nightsoul's Blessing: Xilonen</color>\\nContinuously consume Nightsoul points. When these points are depleted or if used again, this Nightsoul's Blessing state will end. This state has the following traits:\\n·Switches to the Blade Roller mode, increasing Xilonen's Movement SPD and climbing speed, and she can perform high-speed leaps in Ocelot Form while climbing.\\n·Xilonen's Nightsoul's Blessing has the following restrictions: When in this state, Xilonen's Nightsoul points have a 9s time limit. After this limit passes, her Nightsoul points will immediately expire.\\n\\nAfter Xilonen's Nightsoul points have expired while she is in the Nightsoul's Blessing state, she will no longer be able to generate Nightsoul points via the Passive Talent \"Netotiliztli's Echoes.\"\\n\\n<i>In some ways, gem-craft and music-mixing share similar principles: Filtering out impurities and retaining only the most radiant things.\\nXilonen isn't picky about the two, however. She enjoys both immensely, after all!</i>",
