Some say that he was born into poverty, and the resultant burning hunger for fame and fortune drives his boundless desire to create.\\nIn truth, he simply pursues novelty in his capacity as a performer — indeed, he feels that if he cannot put his whole heart into the show, his deep desire to perform cannot be fully satiated.\\nThis is why, despite the applause rising to a fever pitch and beyond, he will rarely satisfy the crowd's calls for a reprise of his most well-known tricks. Some devoted fans consider this to be a bit of a shame...\\n...And for them, such regret will only continue to increase each time they purchase a ticket and go in to watch his show.",

                "Text": "While Lyney first began his journey in magic to fill his stomach, he has continued to perfect his art even after becoming a person of some renown in Fontaine.\\nMagic, after all, has been his benefactor. Not only has it allowed him and his sister to survive, but it has also allowed them to gain the \"acknowledgment\" that most children, growing up in a loving home, would have received from their parents.\\nEven from an early age, performance was something closely tied to Lyney's life. Each time he would go on stage, Lyney would have the audience whooping and clapping. And yet, he did not lose himself in their adulation — if anything, it often troubled him.\\nIf audiences were simply drawn to the spectacle of magic, then who was to say that they wouldn't abandon Lyney's stage as soon as they caught wind of a more enthralling show in town?\\nIn other words, just as an audience would be attracted by petals and cards, they would also be pulled away by grander fireworks and crackling gun salutes. What else did magicians have up their sleeves to capture the hearts of their audience, beyond enticing them with ever more grandiose impressions of shock and awe?\\nIn all of Lyney's performances afterward, audiences would begin to notice a change — Lyney would add many segments between performances in which he would interact with them.\\nIndeed, this magician seemed without any airs, sharing various fascinating anecdotes about his life, not even minding if the audience should try to guess at the secret behind his tricks.\\nOf course, the sharper wits amongst them would notice that Lyney's tales were not truth, but instead a way to build up the atmosphere, a bedding laid for a greater magic trick to land upon.\\nYet no one would quibble about these white lies. After all, truth and falsehoods were already inextricable in many parts of the performance — why, even the magician himself could be said to have become a part of the magic.\\nThus does Lyney sometimes appear near and dear, and other times just out of the reach of his audience, balancing human affinity and magical mystery perfectly in the palm of his hand, his smile leaving the audiences' imaginations free to run wild.\\nNo matter how rich or poor, sad or glad the audience member, imagination is the great equalizer, carrying the charm of magic to all.\\nThus did the mystery and elegance of this magician spread far and wide, with people even opining that his skill at creating an atmosphere is itself as exquisite as magic.\\n\"Is that so? Well, I'm just trying to invite everyone to take a brief break from reality, that's all.\"",

                "Text": "Lyney's new home was the Hotel Bouffes d'ete, located in a corner of the Court of Fontaine.\\nThe place was home to many orphans who shared similar experiences with him and his sister. The people here helped each other like a family would, greeting the fallout and consequences of those tragic years together.\\nBut the siblings, even with a recommendation from the manager of the Hotel, did not find it all that easy to fit in, nor was it easy for the children there to immediately accept these new \"outsiders.\"\\nAnd in this environment, oppressive in its gloom, the water pumping equipment broke while Lynette was using it, right before everyone's eyes, deepening the distrust to the extreme.\\nLyney could only step up and take responsibility, agreeing to fix the equipment so as not to affect everyone's daily lives.\\nIn truth, he did not know all that much about repair work, but given Lynette's propensity for damaging various small devices, he had long gotten used to following his intuition to do some fixes here and there.\\nUnfortunately, he underestimated the complexity of the pumping equipment and difficulty of fixing it. While he succeeded in restoring it to normal operations, he remained at a complete loss as to whether he had solved the root problem or not, he could not tell.\\nBut just as he was at his wit's end, a seemingly reticent young fellow stepped forth, examined, and restored the facilities, even expressing his apologies.\\nAs it turned out, he was the one in charge of maintenance at the Hotel, and as he saw it, Lynette had been the unfortunate victim of his failure to detect and replace the aging components in the system in a timely manner.\\nLyney, for his part, was far more impressed by the young fellow's skills than any talk of responsibility. He wanted to learn from the youth — if nothing else, this would make helping Lynette all the easier.\\nThe youth was, for his part, no good at refusing, and thus did Lyney become his assistant in the Hotel's small workroom — and over time, he and this Freminet would become friends.\\nLyney would prove unselfish in spending time on other Hotel residents, whether it be Freminet or others, but he would keep them company in comforting silence rather than ask them about their experiences.\\nIn this he was guided by Lynette's succinct life advice: \"No one needs self-satisfied concern.\"\\nIn time, the residents became more willing to share some of their pasts with him, and Lyney would thus become better able to help them with their issues.\\nFreminet was somewhat perplexed by this, believing that Lyney, who was slowly becoming the core around which the Hotel spun, did not need to go this far.\\nLyney joked that he had helped Freminet when they first met because he knew that his sister would cause further machine-related troubles down the line, and he was uncomfortable with that.\\nBut at this point, there was no fooling Freminet with such words. Under his attentive gaze, Lyney could only tell him the truth.\\n\"Because Lynette's my one and only family, I've learned from her how one should treat all members of their family.\"",

Lynette had purchased large amounts of festive ornaments, and together with the other children, she strung up colored streamers and hung handwritten festive greetings.\\nFreminet was ensuring that the magical props would operate properly — Lyney had faith in his craftsmanship, so much so that Freminet was completely entrusted with all the magic props this time.\\nLyney himself was the busiest of all — not only did he have to ascertain everyone's progress, but he was also laying the final groundwork for a grand, unique magic trick in secret.\\nAnd thus was the banquet successfully held with everyone's support. The children danced to the joyous music playing from the grand hall's phonograph and enjoyed delicious food — this was the birthday of no one in particular, but this was the day they all felt they had gained new lives.\\nThe finale, of course, was Lyney, Lynette, and Freminet's Founding Day magic show. The magic box was at the center of the room, and all waited with bated breath.\\nTo preserve the secret behind the magic trick, even Lynette and Freminet knew not what was within. But as the room darkened and all eyes turned to Lyney, standing as he was in front of the box, even the highly-experienced magician showed some rare signs of trepidation.\\n\"Now, you might consider the following words an exaggeration, but the \"present\" I am about to present to you all is, without doubt, the most important one we have received in our lives.\"\\nThe paper firecrackers burst, and the once-empty box suddenly opened by itself. The crowd cheered, amazed — then fell suddenly into stunned silence.\\nWhat stood onstage was no present — nay, this was the Hotel's manager, its owner, and their \"Father.\"\\nHer image was one of unsmiling dignity, and thus, though she did not come by often, no one dared to horse around whenever she was around.\\nSurely, Lyney had gone completely mad to have her make her appearance in such a frivolous way.\\nYet, upon seeing the crowd's reaction, \"Father\" did not snap at anyone, opining merely that Lyney had kept this secret perfectly, just as a magic show should, declaring it worthy of praise.\\nThat night, the children and their \"Father\" delighted in the various desserts together, and she personally sliced a serving of cake for each of them, which she herself enjoyed some of as well.\\nPerhaps the most amazing aspect of Lyney's Founding Day magic show was its ability to have even \"Father\" lay down her heavy burden and enjoy a brief moment of familial love.",

More often than not, this makes things go more smoothly, with everyone getting the results they want.\\nBut lies will not simply scatter on the wind, and Lyney must maintain this illusion with utmost care, all the while keeping his distance from those affected.\\nAs so the tower extended towards the skies, until there would be no one to take his hand if he reached out, and even their visages blurred in his eyes.\\nFalsehood was Lyney's constant and only companion on the path that he walked, and this road was long and lonely — this he was always clear-minded about.\\nEveryone knew the brilliant \"Great Magician Lyney,\" but they loved only the mystery, the romance, the unattainable nature. They knew no love for the heart that lay deeper within.\\nHe felt he had no right to pour out his mind to others, and yet he must carry on with gritted teeth, for the price of a fall from such heights was more than he could bear.\\nHaving played too many parts, even Lyney would sometimes find himself questioning who \"he\" really was.\\nHis dreams often took him back to the tower, where his resting place at the pinnacle vantage would grow smaller and smaller, and with the fog of death they called \"betrayal\" extending all around, there was nowhere for him to go.\\nBut just before he could plummet, a hand grabbed onto him — and from it, he felt a familiar warmth that drew his soul back into his body, steadying \"him\" within himself once more.\\n\"Thank you, Lynette...\"\\nThe awakening youth mumbled to himself.",

Only the influence of \"Father\" and her control over the inner workings of the Court of Fontaine prevent any serious incidents from occurring.\\nThere was once an official funded by Lyney who served in the Maison Gardiennage. This person provided both intel in support of the Hotel's operations and scrubbed clean the effects of some of the Hotel's clandestine actions.\\nThese were actions that came with no small risk, but the official always performed them well, for he believed that the Fontaine of the present day needed someone like \"Father\" who could bypass the many layers of laws and regulations and take direct action.\\nLyney once joked to him: \"I'll be there if you ever need help, and if you're in danger, I'll come to rescue you... Well, don't expect too much of that last bit. Just stay on guard, alright?\"\\nThe official knew that this was Lyney's way of expressing concern, of course. Yet even words spoken in jest could prove prophetic later, and so they did — this official's deeds were eventually discovered, and on the brink of capture, he used an emergency communication device to send a message to Lyney.\\nUpon discovering the device, the Gardes who arrived at the scene mocked the official's naivete, claiming that the signal sent merely informed his compatriots to save themselves — no one would be stupid enough to try to save him.\\nThe official's reply was also quite simple — even such an ending would have been fine for him, for he did not believe that his prior cooperation was the wrong decision.\\nBut just as the Gardes were about to arrest the official, thick smoke began billowing forth from dispensers pre-planted nearby, and the official caught sight of a brilliant blaze—\\nThe next moment, he was in the drink in the Fleuve Cendre, and was rescued by Freminet.\\nIt was said that the Gardes spent a great deal of time chasing after the skyborne flame-trail, believing that the criminal must have used some flying machine to flee the scene, only to discover later naught but wood dressed in clothes, affixed to a glider.\\nIn truth, Lyney had earlier used this device to draw the Gardes' attention away before getting the official out of his predicament.\\nThe official admitted that he had not had high hopes when pressing the device. Magicians were untrustworthy, after all — but still, he had chosen to gamble on that tiny chance.\\n\"Haha. Well, it is indeed a gamble to place your trust in others.\"\\n\"But don't worry.

Indeed, Rosseland's requests were not terribly excessive.

Not only had the siblings been together since childhood, but he knew that he was not the only one who felt disturbed by this split.\\nHe still desired to be beside her, lending her all the help he could — this was his non-negotiable desire.\\nKnowing his desire for power was no longer pure, Lyney concluded that he had become undeserving of divine favor. Yet he still desired a means to bridge the vast gulf in strength between him and his sister, which he did not possess. Unless...\\nTo this end, he solemnly sought out \"Father,\" expressing his belief that he needed the mysterious and perilous might of a Delusion to operate alongside his sister.\\n\"Father\" was silent for a long while, till at last two slanted crosses pinned him in place with a wrath rarely shown to the children of the Hotel, her gaze seeming to pierce his very soul.\\n\"And would Lynette want you to do this?\"\\nHer simple yet powerful question cut through the strings that bound his heart, and in a daze, his sister's words once more reverberated in his ears.\\n\"No one needs self-satisfied concern.\"\\nLyney did not need to ask his sister to know that she would never accept his desire to stay by her side with the use of a Delusion. It was only then that he realized the absurdity of his wish.\\n\"Father\" stood up and left, but not before reminding him that this was not the first time he had lacked power, but that he had found an answer before.\\nLyney would lock himself in his room, trying to digest the reasoning behind the words \"Father\" had left him with. When he and his sister had been out on the streets, the answer he had found then had been \"magic.\" What, then, would the answer be now?\\nLyney found the dossiers for all the missions Lynette had taken up during this period, carefully analyzing the process of each one and modeling his sister's every action.\\nWas it really necessary to pass through this dangerous valley to get close to a target?\\nWas it really a must to leap into such a swift river to flee the scene?\\nNo, this was just the Vision's light covering her.\\nThus did Lyney start to make comprehensive plans for his sister's missions, using his understanding of her to design the most suitable routes, make the most practical tools, and choose the best rendezvous points.\\nThe trust between them did not change. The look in Lynette's eyes when she left was no longer so strained, and they often embraced heartily and happily when meeting at the rendezvous point.\\nThe pure desire to protect one's family would not be moved, gods' favor or no.\\nBut even the best laid plans of mice and men may go awry. After conducting dozens of successful missions, the children of the Hotel were caught up in a betrayal, and as a result, Lynette's movements were exposed.\\nBefore the siblings was a towering cliff, just like the night when Lynette had gained her Vision — but this time, it was Lyney's turn to reverse their fortunes in a moment of crisis.\\nHe opened his emergency paraglider, and grabbing her, threw himself off the edge. But their pursuers followed, raining gunfire down on them.\\nLyney twisted this way and that, avoiding many a shot, but still the glider was punctured in several spots. Unable to maintain balance, they began to plummet downward towards the embrace of the ground below.\\nStill, Lyney grit his teeth and refused to despair — should fate itself conspire to refute the answer he had come up with to protect his family, he would defy it to the end.\\nTheir pursuers began to snicker, knowing that a fall at such speeds would be fatal — only to have a flame light up the skies, pushing the stricken glider toward a fast-flowing river nearby.\\nThe power of Pyro changed the direction of their fall, while Anemo defended them from harm — and thus did the twin lights intertwine and spread under the moonlight, fading slowly like the applause that fills the stage during a curtain call.\\nLyney did not guess at the meaning of the shining Vision he saw in his hand.
