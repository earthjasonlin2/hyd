You talk a lot too, and you fly, plus... didn't you get yourself a pair of silly-looking glasses in Fontaine?\\n<color=#37FFFF>Paimon:</color> ...That is completely different!\\n<color=#37FFFF>Paimon:</color> But anyway, there's a more glaring issue here... Ajaw is flat as a pancake! He's floating around looking like a little cardboard cutout, and no one in Natlan bats an eyelid!

Then again, maybe everyone's just used to it by now.\\n<color=#37FFFF>{NICKNAME}:</color> Ultimately, it nobody's business but Ajaw's, so if you want answers, you'd probably have to ask him.\\n<color=#37FFFF>Paimon:</color> But would he even tell us the truth? Paimon gets the feeling he'd just make up a bunch of phony-baloney to get us off his case...\\n<color=#37FFFF>Paimon:</color> *gasp* Or maybe... He'd be like, \"Okay, if you really wanna know... I'll show you!\" And then poof! He'd turn us into cardboard cutouts too!\\n<color=#37FFFF>{NICKNAME}:</color> Heh...
