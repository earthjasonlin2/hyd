    "Desc": "If you can stay within the Ideal Tension Zone while fishing, this rod will shorten the time in which fish will struggle by a stable amount and increase your chances of success. This effect only works in Mondstadt.\\n\\nA long, bright, transparent rod created by a poet from Mondstadt. To help borrow the power of Anemo to help raise the rod, the poet rather ingeniously designed a fishing reel made from the leaves of Windwheel Asters, which also imparts a certain romanticism of \"lingering in the wind\" to this device. But perhaps there were issues in the handiwork or in the design itself, for the finalized product could not spin as freely as expected. Perhaps this is what they call \"the chasm between professions?\"",
