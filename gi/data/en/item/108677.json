    "Name": "Delicious Bulle Sauce Duck Breast",
    "Desc": "A meat dish with the fragrant fullness of fruit. The citrusy flavor of tangerine gives the succulent duck a unique, fresh sweetness. It's so irresistibly delicious that you can barely stop yourself from reaching for the next piece even before you've swallowed the last one. No matter how much Fontaine's food culture has evolved over the years, it's no surprise that this dish has always kept its place among the classics.",
