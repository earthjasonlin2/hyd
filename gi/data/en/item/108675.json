    "Name": "Suspicious Bulle Sauce Duck Breast",
    "Desc": "A meat dish with the fragrant fullness of fruit. The sauce hasn't counteracted the greasiness of the duck at all â€” in fact, it's given it a bitter edge instead. The appetite evoked upon seeing it presented so beautifully seems to have disappeared equally as suddenly after your first bite.",
