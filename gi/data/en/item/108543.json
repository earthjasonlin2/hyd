    "Desc": "A famous Fontainian cuisine. \"Vessie\" means \"bladder\" in Fontaine. As the name suggests, the seasoned chicken meat is enclosed in a forest boar's bladder when being poached in a meat broth. The bladder will puff out during the process like a rotund Specter. People usually only eat the chicken meat inside.",
