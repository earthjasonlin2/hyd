Inside the amber, a small, long-extinct insect remains frozen in time.\\nTo the tree, it was circumstance that led this little life to be wreathed within its amber. But for said life, this was fate.\\nFollowing the heaven-sent disaster, wood, vines, roots, and all manner of flora withered and turned to dust. A great many life forms disappeared.\\nBut in the stillness of amber, a nameless insect endures in this otherworldly oasis, reaching a future that no others of its kind could.",
