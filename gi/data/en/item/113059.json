    "Name": "Fragment of a Golden Melody",
    "Desc": "A golden fragment that fell from the centaur golem's chest. Putting the tune inscribed upon the shattered rubble back together, it appears to be a small sliver of a grander musical movement.\\nPeople once believed that the song of eternal happiness and harmony would resound throughout the world till the end of all destinies. But harmonies can be changed.
