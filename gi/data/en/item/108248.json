    "Name": "Delicious Chicken Tofu Pudding",
    "Desc": "A dish that requires great precision to make. Successfully formed into a single block with no debris, it truly looks like tofu pudding. Its exquisite tenderness unravels on the tongue the moment it is scooped up with a porcelain spoon and fed into the mouth, and the taste is so sublime that it almost feels like having an out-of-body experience. What lies before you is no mere dish, but a gentle breeze, a pure spring, a stroke of the divine.",
