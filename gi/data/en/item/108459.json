    "Name": "Delicious Padisarah Pudding",
    "Desc": "A popular dessert in Sumeru. The moment it enters your mouth, the springy mouthfeel makes you feel like you're wandering atop milk-flavored clouds. As you savor its flavors, the blended fragrance of Padisarah and Sumeru Rose fills the air. When you finally do reach that very last bite, it feels like something has been left unfinished. You cannot help but lick the back of your spoon, as if to savor the final sublime moments of enjoyment.",
