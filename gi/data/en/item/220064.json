    "Desc": "In some cosmological settings, this is a staff filled with mystical power. It can resonate with the Future Stars and show the way to them.\\nOf course, in some other settings, it might be an object kept in storage by an organization known as the Akademiya, and perhaps its recorded name might even be Ayesha's Chaos Prospector. There is a thin layer of dust over this object due to a long period of disuse.",
