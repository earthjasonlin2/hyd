    "Name": "Delicious Fontinalia Mousse",
    "Desc": "A true blue Fontinalia Festival snack. Its crystalline coloration would not be ashamed if compared to the light scattering off the rippling waves. Its featherweight elegance is like that of falling petals, its airy texture like a snowflake melting in your throat. To eat such a delicacy must surely be the loveliest thing that could happen during the Festival!",
