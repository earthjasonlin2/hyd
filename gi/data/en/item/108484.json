    "Desc": "A dish with ground meat as its base. After crushing the wheat and cooking it over a fire, ground meat was added to form the outer layer. Onions and meat were then stir-fried to make the filling. Finally, the mixture was molded into balls and deep-fried until golden. Enjoying meat by the mouthful has never been this easy!",
