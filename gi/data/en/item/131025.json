    "Name": "Sandstorm Angler",
    "Desc": "A medium-sized, round fish with horn-like cartilage that is used to dig underwater burrows, build shelters and drive away creatures that try to harm it. \\nThis sandy-colored, plain-looking fish is an important breed. Researchers have managed to deduce the ecological characteristics of the whole pufferfish lineage from the anatomy of this species. With its immense strength and strongest horns amongst its kind, this fish acts as an \"underwater workhorse.\" They have evolved their protective coloration as a result of long-term activities in the riverbed and the bottom of the lake, along with spending all their days with pervasive river and lake sand as companions.",
