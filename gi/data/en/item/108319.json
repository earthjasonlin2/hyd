    "Name": "Invigorating Kitty Meal",
    "Desc": "This main dish looks rather cute. With Kiminami Anna's help, this dish was made with the tastes of provisional head priestess Neko in mind. Although it does not quite match the flavor that Hibiki used to produce, Lady Neko seems rather pleased with your work nonetheless. Due to the lack of spices, humans might find this dish a tad on the plain side.",
