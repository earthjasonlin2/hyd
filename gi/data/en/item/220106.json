    "Name": "Kaboom Box",
    "Desc": "A mechanism that continually absorbs the force it receives.\\nApparently, when the power within reaches bursting point, it will explode in a dazzling display of fireworks. But the amount of force needed to trigger this explosion seems to vary each time... So why not take turns attacking it with your friends? They say that whoever makes it go \"kaboom\" will have extraordinarily good luck for the rest of the day.",
