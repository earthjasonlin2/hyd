    "Name": "Delicious Tri-Flavored Skewer",
    "Desc": "A pieced-together skewer. The highly-refined temperature control has released sizzling blooms of oils. The many seasonings accentuate the flavor of the various ingredients. If there was but a little less of them, it would be too plain; if a little more, too dense. This keen balance reveals the craftsman's heart within the chef.",
