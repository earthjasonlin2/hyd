    "Name": "Suspicious Fontinalia Mousse",
    "Desc": "A true blue Fontinalia Festival snack. That said, a true tragedy seems to have befallen this serving, reminding one of nothing so much as a Cryo Whopperflower... Are you sure the Lakelight Lilies in this one weren't, in truth, Whopperflowers? Uh, best you get rid of this on the down low... serving a dish like this during the festival might just be a chargeable offense!",
