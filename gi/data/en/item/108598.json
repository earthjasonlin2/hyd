    "Desc": "A simple countryside stew. Simply put all the ingredients in a casserole, mix them up, and cook until they are ready to serve. It is worth noting that the full name of this dish is \"Glabrous Beans, Fowl Confit, and Smoked Sausage Stew in Cassoulet Casserole with a Side of Marcotte.\" The intimidating lengthiness of the name has, understandably, driven people to just call it \"Cassoulet.\"",
