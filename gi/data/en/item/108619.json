    "Desc": "Chevreuse's specialty. There is something indubitably \"sinful\" about this dish from a health standpoint. As the leader of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, she will not lightly hand the task of dealing with sin to others â€” this is a matter of professionalism and personal ethics, after all.
