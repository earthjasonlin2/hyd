    "Name": "Suspicious Stir-Fried Shrimp",
    "Desc": "A mild and luscious dish. In an overzealous attempt to prevent the food from sticking to the bottom of the pot, too much oil was added. Despite having been subjected to this rather heavy-duty frying process, the shrimp still have a surprisingly pleasant texture â€” but mind you don't eat too many, or you'll get a sore throat.",
