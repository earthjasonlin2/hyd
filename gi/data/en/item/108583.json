Chop up the sheep offal, mix it with oatmeal, and stuff the mixture into a sheep stomach along with various seasonings and spices to form a bag. When the dish is served, this stomach-bag is usually removed while the fillings are served with radish paste and mashed potatoes. This is a local specialty that Fontainians often cook as a treat for important guests.",
