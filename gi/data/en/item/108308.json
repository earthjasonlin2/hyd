    "Name": "Delicious Rice Pudding",
    "Desc": "A dessert made from rice. The soft, sticky rice and the sweet milk have melded together perfectly, their tastes complementing each other. If you eat it hot, you can enjoy the dense rice grains, and if you leave it till it's cold, you can savor the gentle fragrance of milk â€” each possessing its own beauty. People who eat such a dish cannot help but wonder: how many experiments led up to this moment?",
