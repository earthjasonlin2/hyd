    "Name": "Curry Shrimp",
    "Desc": "A common household dish in Sumeru. The shrimps are first boiled until chewy, then added into the curry broth. The perfect blend of savory curry and flavors from the ocean is enough to make one's stomach growl. Though it's a common household dish, almost every family seems to have made their own variations to the recipe. Perhaps one could say that for every Sumeru household, there'll be a different version of curry shrimp.",
