    "Name": "Meat Lovers' Mushroom Pizza",
    "Desc": "A pizza freshly baked from the oven. The crust is dotted with large chunks of meat and fresh mushroom slices. The sweet, stretchy cheese further adds to the charm. You have no doubt that every slice will be snatched away the moment it is served. Speed, therefore, is a gourmet's best buddy when this pizza is on the table.",
