    "Name": "Delicious Fontainian Foie Gras",
    "Desc": "A traditional dish of Fontaine. The tender and buttery foie gras greets your tastebuds with silky dance moves before waltzing down your throat like smooth satin. Such a supreme delight makes all other dishes you will have in the future taste bland in comparison â€” that being said, you can hardly regret eating it, can you?",
