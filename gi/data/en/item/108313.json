    "Desc": "A dish that is a test of one's knifework. All the ingredients were sliced into ribbons in a single go, and after being washed, they were placed into the broth and cooked till they floated. The resulting flavor is light and fresh, and would not be out of place as a chef's recommendation in a Liyue restaurant.",
