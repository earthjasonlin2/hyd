    "Desc": "A bottle that is able to hold Anemograna and use their energy to generate wind currents.\\nThis item was designed by Knights of Favonius scholars to help the Knights on their scouting expeditions and travels by affording them the ability to better use the blessings of the Anemo God.\\nIn order to take advantage of its wind currents with a wind glider, however, you technically need a gliding license â€” this has prevented it from becoming widely used, at least legally anyway.",
