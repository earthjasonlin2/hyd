    "Desc": "Specialized refinement material for \"Ballad of the Boundless Blue.\"\\nIn many poems and tales, Dandelions are a symbol of unrestrained freedom, traveling to faraway lands. Placing a bookmark with the image of a Dandelion within the pages of a book is not a form of confinement, but rather allowing it to wander in a world far vaster and brighter than our own.",
