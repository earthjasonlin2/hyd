It will come in handy when you take photos of beautiful scenery, look for inspiration in the wilderness, or wish to keep festive memories!\\nThis Kamera is adorned with metal decorations and thus looks a lot more expensive than regular Kameras. Be careful with it!\\nAccording to the leasing agreement, it can only be used within Sumeru's borders.",
