    "Name": "Delicious Charcoal-Baked Ajilenakh Cake",
    "Desc": "A dark-colored pastry. The pastry is fine, almost lustrous, and the fragrance of the Ajilenakh Nuts is both vivid and full of warmth. The cake is fluffy and delicate as it enters your mouth, exorcising exhaustion and muzzling misery. Ah, just as a book may not be judged by its cover, so too should a cake not be convicted by its crust.",
