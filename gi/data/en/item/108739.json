    "Desc": "A deep-fried snack. The oil in the pot has mercilessly stripped the shrimp of moisture, resulting in a shriveled texture that could have been shown magnanimity if not for the jarring, hard mouthfeel. It's a good thing there are only two products... That makes dealing with them easy enough.",
