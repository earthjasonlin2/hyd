    "Desc": "This exquisite horn is a Fontainian instrument that can be used in performances, and was a gift from Dvorak to you.\\nThey say the tones of the horn are both rich and mellow as well as gentle, like a gentle evening breeze blowing among a thicket of trees. So, Fontainian composers often use horns to vividly bring the imagery of hunters and forests to life. Without a doubt, this instrument is eminently suited to a musical gala celebrating \"life.\"",
