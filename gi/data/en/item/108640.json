    "Name": "Deep-Fried Doublecrisp",
    "Desc": "One of Liyue's famous dishes. Between the fierce heat, the boiling oil, and the saut√©ing process, this is a stern test of one's skills. Cook for a few seconds too few, and your ingredients might be left raw. Too many, and they will be overcooked and lacking in crispness. As such, this dish is often chosen by experienced Liyue chefs to display their mastery.",
