    "Name": "Delicious Tonkotsu Ramen",
    "Desc": "A steaming-hot noodle dish. The springy noodles have absorbed the essence of the soup, and the accoutrements have added all manner of variation to the mouthfeel. The soup has preserved the strong fragrance of the bones used to make it, yet goes down gently without that greasy feeling. Before you know it, the bowl's all gone, and you've still got room for more.",
