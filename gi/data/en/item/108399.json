    "Desc": "An Aranara-style salad that Paimon drained her brain juice dry to improve. It is, in fact, a rather traditional recipe in Sumeru. Crispy and juicy Zaytun Peaches are served with fresh mints and blooming roses. This delicacy tastes refreshingly sweet and feels pleasantly cool on the tongue â€” This must be \"the Taste of Happiness,\" as Aranara say.",
