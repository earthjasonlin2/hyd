    "Desc": "Noodles that are as slender as the hairs on a dragon's beard. The slim noodles are as a waterfall, draping their way into a soup that has captured the very essence of the mountains themselves. The softer mouthfeel compared to the average noodle dish makes it nigh impossible to stop eating once you've started.",
