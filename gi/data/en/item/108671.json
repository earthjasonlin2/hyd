    "Name": "Bulle Souffle",
    "Desc": "A very small cake nestled within a Bulle Fruit skin. Pour the beaten egg whites into a Bulle Fruit skin that has been scraped empty, and bake it until the souffle has evenly expanded. The word \"Bulle\" isn't a part of the name just because it's in the ingredient list, but because the finished product allows the tongue to delight in bubble-like spongy softness.",
