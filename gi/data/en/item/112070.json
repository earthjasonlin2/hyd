Be it the Hypostases' pure ordered elements or the ancient primitive power of the dragons, these people believed that they might all be replicated and modified to the point where they had surpassed their natural counterparts.\\nBy this means, a superior and unsullied bodily form could replace the continuously decaying and shattering order.",
