    "Desc": "A seafood dish made using fresh ingredients. The plate spread before you is like a work of art, almost too beautiful to shatter. The surpassing knife-work has imparted the greatest mouthfeel upon the ingredients possible. The delicate texture, the exquisite springiness, the natural sweetness... it is like something living is leaping inside your mouth â€” straight from the ocean and into your heart.",
