    "Name": "Purple Shirakodai",
    "Desc": "A gentle, elegant butterflyfish variant. It has a lovely, streamlined dorsal fin, and has the nickname \"Queen of the Waters.\"\\nLovely purple patterns run across its body, and they love to swim together in schools to fend off natural dangers and predators. But once this quirk of theirs was grasped by seasoned fisherpeople, they realized that all one needed to do was to lure a single fish into the trap, and all the rest would follow.",
