    "Name": "Candied Ajilenakh Nut",
    "Desc": "A rich dessert. First, the syrup is boiled till clear, then mixed with fillings and sesame paste from Sumeru. Then at last, the evenly-mixed syrup is poured into a mold and allowed to solidify into this crunchy form. It is said that the cold lands of Snezhnaya are a host to a similar dish, with a slightly different flavor profile. Of course, both sides naturally believe theirs to be the greatest in all Teyvat.",
