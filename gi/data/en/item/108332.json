    "Desc": "A snack shaped like a snapper. Fresh out of the oven, this taiyaki gives off a titillating aroma while it is still a mite scalding to the touch. A single bite causes the sweetness to melt in your mouth instantly. The feeling is akin to watching a fish in a pool bathed in sunset's gleam, its scales attaining a golden sheen.",
