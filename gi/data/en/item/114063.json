    "Desc": "Weapon Ascension Material.\\nIt is said that the Sage of the Stolen Flame, after imparting the secret knowledge of the mastery of flames in all their many forms to the tribespeople, hoped that they would climb the ladder of civilization and abandon the wrongful practices of their forebears.\\nYet dogma deeply entrenched is difficult indeed to shake, and the now empowered youngsters instead ignited conflicts within their own tribes merely for the sake of more offerings. This may explain the sage's eventual disillusionment and withdrawal from history.\\nNotably, it was precisely during the reign of the Sacred Lord of the ineffable city that the practice of offering live sacrifices was banned outright. Though the Sacred Lord's true motivation for abolishing many of their customs was the consolidation of authority, this particular act might also be seen as the start of a new kind of civilization.",
