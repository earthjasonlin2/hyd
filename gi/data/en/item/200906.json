This effect only works in Fontaine.\\n\\nA slender fishing rod with a beautiful metallic glamor. Made of innovative metal materials designed by the Fontaine Research Institute, it combines light weight and resistance. Thanks to the solid metal loops reinforcing the connections between each section, the rod is capable of bearing fish of astonishing weight. Moreover, the reel seat is modeled after the handguards on weapon handles, protecting the angler from being damaged by fierce and \"tough\" fish. \\nAccording to experienced fishers, this rod is the perfect weapon against \"Iron Fish,\" the specialty of Fontaine, and is comparable to a trusty lance.",
