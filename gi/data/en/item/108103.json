    "Desc": "A crab dish cooked in the ancient ways. The aroma of the crab meat inundates the room the instant it leaves the frying pan, and a single bite fills one's palate with the countless rustic flavors of a fishing village hometown. It seems that such simple yet timeless village customs held the secret to this lavish, golden sumptuousness all along.",
