    "Desc": "An Aranara-style dish that Paimon has drained her brain juice dry to improve. But in fact, it only requires a few common mushrooms from Sumeru, along with some extra seasonings. Paimon selected three types of mushrooms, and they were prepared and then cooked in a simple way, but the texture and flavor aren't bad at all.",
