    "Name": "Delicious Mushroom Hodgepodge",
    "Desc": "An Aranara-style dish that Paimon drained her brain juice dry to improve. But in fact, it only requires a few common mushrooms from Sumeru, along with some extra seasonings. The heat and cooking time have been adjusted to preserve the distinctive flavors of three different types of mushrooms. Depending on one's preference, they can either be eaten together or one at a time to study the subtly varying flavors.",
