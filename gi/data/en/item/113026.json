    "Desc": "A warped shard that houses great might. You obtained this from defeating Signora, who unleashed her original power.\\nThe seal of ice was broken under duress, and as her former will surged forth from its pale white prison and she remembered her old name once more, the undying butterfly danced amidst burning flesh and blood. And she remembered her past, wandering the land, spreading the flame, burning away all evil â€” and she recalled the face of the person she could never meet again.",
