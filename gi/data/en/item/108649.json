    "Name": "Fine Tea, Full Moon",
    "Desc": "A tea pastry containing egg yolk. The salted yolk is first steamed, then stuffed and wrapped in tea powder-infused dough. It's then kneaded into the shape of a full moon before being baked. This results in a crispy, flaky exterior with a salty and sweet interior, the different layers forming a delicious and addictive delicacy.",
