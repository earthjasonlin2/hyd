    "Name": "Delicious Dry-Braised Salted Fish",
    "Desc": "Dried fish that has been grilled slowly over a charcoal flame. The rich fats ooze out as the fish meets the grill, and with those sizzling sounds, the fish is clothed in a burnished golden coat. The meat is firm but delicious, and the mouthfeel is quite delicate. Such is the unsurpassed gift of the seas.",
