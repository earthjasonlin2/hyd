    "Name": "Sweet-Flower Medaka",
    "Desc": "A lively, energetic fish famous for its petal-shaped tail.\\nIt might be because this fish has a sweet tooth, but every bone in its body seems to serve as an antenna to seek out sweet treats. Following this absolute ideology, they swim through every creek and river in Teyvat in search of tasty sweets. True egalitarians, they will never reject any morsel, and certainly not because there's a hook attached. Have bait, will bite, as they say.\\nBeginner friendly.",
