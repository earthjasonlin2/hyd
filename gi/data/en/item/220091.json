    "Name": "Portable Aerodynamic Gelatinous Bubble Generator",
    "Desc": "A mechanism that can be used to create large amounts of colloid bubbles.\\n\\nGivalois, a researcher from the Fontaine Research Institute, developed this prototype.\\nThe original purpose was to create a large generator of gelatinous bubbles. Just as the project aimed to do, the bubbles so produced could carry some amount of water within them, and move or hover stably in the air, potentially achieving the aim of being able to quickly transport water resources.\\nHowever, as they were never able to find a material to make gelatinous bubbles of this type, the project stalled at the prototype stage.\\nBut it is said the researcher Givalois's children loved this prototype bubble machine, so perhaps it would be possible to sell it as a toy?\\n\\n\"This machine is a product of Daddy's research, and it's called the Portable Aerodynamic Gelatinous Bubble Generator...\"\\n\"Bubbles! So pretty! Daddy, you're amazing!\"",
