    "Name": "\"The Boon of the Elder Tree\"",
    "Desc": "A talisman that can help collect wood.\\nTalismans of this kind are often seen in the forests in Sumeru. They possess the ability to gather the power of grass and trees.\\nTo prevent the erosion of the forest and, in darker times, to resist the invasion of vicious monsters, trees and vines would form impregnable shelters together. Those who held \"the Boon of the Elder Tree\" were recognized by the forest as its friends and thus gained unfettered access to walk amidst the forest under the guidance of streams and moonlight. But that is archaic lore from a long, long time ago.",
