    "Desc": "Noodles that are as slender as the hairs on a dragon's beard. The green onion is fried in a wok before the soup and condiments are added. Last in are the noodles, after which the lot is ladled out and plated up. The noodles must be skillfully hand-pulled multiple times before they become extremely thin â€” a technique that makes this dish the most challenging noodle recipe in Liyue.",
