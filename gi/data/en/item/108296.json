    "Name": "Delicious Crab Roe Kourayaki",
    "Desc": "A crab meat dish that has been cooked directly over the flames. The crab meat still has a lovely scarlet shade, and its meat is tender and juicy. The crab roe has a refreshing aroma, and is rich and mellow to the taste. The sheer grace of this entity upon your tongue makes you start to wonder how the crab shell might taste.",
