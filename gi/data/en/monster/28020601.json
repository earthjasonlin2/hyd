    "Name": "Snow Weasel",
    "Desc": "Prank-prone rascals with a slim and agile form.\\nWeasels that come and go as they please, hiding within holes in the snowy plains. They usually hunt bugs and lizards, but they are also unafraid of animals slightly larger than themselves. Due to their cute appearance, people sometimes try to catch weasels and take them as pets, but they are freedom-loving creatures by nature and do not easily consign themselves to the fate of being confined in warm human homes.",
