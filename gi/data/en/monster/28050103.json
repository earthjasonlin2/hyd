    "Desc": "Pure elemental life-forms composed of drifting Cryo particles, as free and unbound as the butterflies they resemble.\\nA glittering Cryo creature that is the product of rising and condensing elements, and which feeds off the power of Cryo that is scattered amidst the mist and frost.\\nThough it is fragile beyond compare, it still dances amidst the blizzard. It is completely harmless by itself, but it is also a portent of the descent of snow, which silences all life.",
