    "Desc": "These intelligent weasels live underground within the mining tunnels and caverns depths of The Chasm. Their fur has a unique blue sheen.\\nHaving long become used to life in the darkness, they now have excellent hearing and olfactory senses.\\nTheir jade-colored eyes and unusual fur have led miners to see them as an omen that gemstones are to be found nearby. However, there is no real connection between the two.",
