    "Desc": "A peculiar bird that can walk on two feet yet cannot spread its wings to fly.

Due to their relative friendliness towards all other creatures, their lack of aggression even when angry, and the fact that even adult Flowcurrent Birds are no taller or heavier than a human child, the People of the Springs are quite happy to let their children play with them...",
