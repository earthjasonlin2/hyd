    "Name": "Gray Snow Cat",
    "Desc": "An agile and wise soul, endowed since birth with a well-maintained elegance and pride.\\n\"Mommy, look, that kitty looks like a dirty wee ball of snow!\" This mischievous cat's name did indeed originate from a young child's faux-pas. Gray Snow Cats are very playful creatures, and any time or place can become a war-zone for their frolicking â€” much to the chagrin of their owners, who must always then give them baths.",
