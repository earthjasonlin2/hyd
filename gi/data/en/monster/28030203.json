    "Desc": "A sharp-eyed and proud glede.\\nA bird of prey that nests in the treetops among the lofty mountain peaks. Legend holds that this bird forever roams the clouds, never setting food on land to nest, but this is a mere product of ignorant fantasy on the one hand and fanciful imagination on the other. Even the Lapis Glede must fight to eat its fill and protect its young.",
