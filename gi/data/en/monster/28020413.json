    "Desc": "Humanity's best friend!\\nThese dogs have dark gold fur, and of Fontaine's hunting hounds their blood is the purest. Loyal, possessed of acute noses, and agile, these aid humans in chasing game and criminals alike.\\nIt is even said that they do well in the water, though few have ever witnessed them swimming â€” most nowadays take this saying to be a curious invention of The Steambird.",
