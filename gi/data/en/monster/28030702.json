    "Name": "Violetgold Angler Gull",
    "Desc": "A medium-sized bird that dwells in Fontaine. It possesses alternating purple and gold feathers.\\nThe Violetgold Angler Gull isn't what most would describe as amiable. They have stolen oily foods straight out of people's hands at the harbor, and sometimes, they even trespass upon fishing boats to get a taste of the fresh fish aboard.\\nTherefore, despite how some insist that \"The Violetgold Angler Gulls are emblems of leisurely shoreside living and cannot be treated harshly,\" fishers still regard them as a sign of trouble and drive them away.",
