    "Name": "Flying Squirrel",
    "Desc": "Small animals with a unique body structure, they can spread their limbs and use their tough wing membranes to glide on the air currents when jumping from a height, reaching places that are difficult for other terrestrial animals to reach...\\nThe techniques Flying Squirrels use to get around are not dissimilar from those used by wind gliders. A legend holds that once, several adventurers who visited Natlan attempted to conduct in-depth research on Flying Squirrels, but the little guys often let their pride run loose while they were riding the wind. It was thus quite difficult to keep up with them, let alone observe their movements in any great detail. Since then, the title of \"Flying Squirrel Level\" has been circulated via the Adventurers' Guild's Natlan branch, which is used to describe those supreme masters who have perfected the art of using wind gliders to the point that they \"glide as agilely as a Flying Squirrel.\"",
