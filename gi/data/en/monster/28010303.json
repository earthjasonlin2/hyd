    "Name": "Blue Frog",
    "Desc": "A small frog that often appears in wetlands.\\nThis animal is very common in wetland areas, and its body secretes a mysterious sticky substance that has much medicinal utility. Blue Frogs are known to frequent cleaner, clearer waters.\\nAccording to observations, various frog species will turn green once the sticky substance on their surfaces dries up. The present hypothesis is that this is a result of some change to its outer skin, and helps to conserve bodily moisture.",
