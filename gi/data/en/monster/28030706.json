    "Desc": "The Viridian Fantail Pigeon are close relatives of Pigeons. They are graceful in appearance, and though they can be used to send messages after being trained, few people use them as messengers.\\nThis type of bird possesses viridescent feathers and a fan-shaped tail. Their personalities are combative and they were once mistaken as the larval form of Jadeplume Terrorshrooms by outsiders that have visited Sumeru before. In actuality, the two life forms have no relations.",
