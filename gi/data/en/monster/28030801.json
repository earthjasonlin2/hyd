In addition, while other birds may appear fluffy but are actually quite sturdy, what the Thick-Feathered Ruffed Pheasant has beneath its thick feathers is... a very thick, round layer of fat. Thus, it strains itself even by flying normally, and has been called a \"Potted plant with wings that can't fly\" by the Scions of the Canopy...",
