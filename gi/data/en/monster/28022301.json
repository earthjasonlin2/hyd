    "Name": "Alpaca",
    "Desc": "These floofy, furry four-legged camelids are elegant and gentle, and get along very well with humans, just like good partners who understand one another...\\nAlthough they look very different, this animal is indeed a distant relative of the Sumpter Beast, and is also of some relation to the Fluff-Fleece Goat. Good at carrying goods over long distances, they are a merchant's best friend. When it's time to rest, you can even snuggle up against them to enjoy a soft, sweet sleep...\\nGenerally speaking, alpacas grow fleece very fast. In order to prevent them from being knocked flat out by the hot climate, people have to trim the alpacas every once in a while. As fortune would have it, the wool made from their fleece is also a superb material for making cloth...",
