It is observed that the Xenohydro has icy blue skin that has silver spots dotted around. If you look through other planes to observe the Xenohydro, you'll find that it looks rather different. In fact, the image of the Xenohydro will vary from person to person.\\n\\n<i>\"I have a feeling that compared with the Xenohydro, this case is the actual curio. It can be worth quite a lot on the curio market.\"</i>",
