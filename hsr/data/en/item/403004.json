They rowed their gondolas quietly above the planet and left before the Legion could notice them, leaving behind a silent eulogy.\\nTime flew by, and the Belobog Architects found a type of beautiful stone that glimmered with bright colors. They mixed the stone with Geomarrow and built a monument, which some say still stands at the heart of Qlipoth Fort in the city of Belobog.\\n\\n<i>\"Even if we fail, this monument will stand for all eternity. Those who come after will find it and know that we once existed.\"</i>",
