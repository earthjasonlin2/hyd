But in a time before the arrival of the sweet dreams, this was the spring water that cleansed both tears and blood, a fine wine made to soothe the bitterness of the years.\\n\\n<i>\"They used flavoring to mask its strange taste, used coloring to hide the poor quality, and used carbonation to deprive it of flatness â€” But the truth hidden within the bottle will never disappear.\"</i>",
