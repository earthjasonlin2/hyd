One creation attempted a big, leisurely stretch while bathing in the starlight, then got injured due to excessive stretching. 2. One creation jumped onto the floor and conversed with its own reflection on the polished floor for 5 minutes. The other creations are very concerned about its mental health. 3. Two creations fell asleep while snuggling against each other. However, one of them experienced a leg cramp and kicked the other dozens of times. Both woke up from the dream and engaged in a heated argument. 4. A passing robot was updating its system today and made strange noises, waking up three creations in the process. 5. Three creations are curled up in the same nest and seeking warmth from each other. The air condition temperature for this area has been reduced.",
